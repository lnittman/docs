## Memory Management

### Three-layer Memory System

#### 1. Project Memory (./CLAUDE.md)
**Purpose**: Team-shared context for the current project
**Location**: `./CLAUDE.md` in project root
**Best Practices**:
```markdown
# Project Name

## Architecture
- Key architectural decisions
- Technology stack with versions
- Important patterns to follow

## Conventions
- Code style specifics
- Naming conventions
- File organization rules

## Common Commands
- `pnpm dev` - Start development
- `pnpm test` - Run tests
- `pnpm build` - Build for production

## Current Focus
- Active feature development
- Known issues to avoid
- Performance considerations
```

### 2. User Memory (~/.claude/CLAUDE.md)
**Purpose**: Personal preferences and cross-project patterns
**Location**: `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`
**Optimize for Your Workflow**:
```markdown
# Personal Development Preferences

## Code Style
- Prefer explicit types over inference
- Use early returns for clarity
- Destructure props at function declaration

## Common Aliases
- @docs → ~/Developer/docs/
- @apps → ~/Developer/apps/

## Frequently Used Patterns
- Always use pnpm over npm
- Prefer Turborepo for monorepos
- Use Tailwind CSS v4 patterns

## Project Templates
- Next.js 15 with App Router
- React Native with Expo
- Node.js with TypeScript
```

### 3. Documentation Repository (~/Developer/docs/)
**Purpose**: Comprehensive reference and patterns library
**Recommended Structure**:
```
~/Developer/docs/
├── apps/                    # Application-specific docs
│   ├── docs.md             # Documentation standards
│   └── patterns.md         # Common patterns
├── prompts/                # Reusable prompts
│   ├── ai/                # AI integration prompts
│   ├── code/              # Code generation prompts
│   └── docs/              # Documentation prompts
├── tools/                  # Tool-specific guides
│   ├── claude-code-power-user.md
│   └── anthropic/         # Official docs
└── reference/             # Quick references
    ├── commands.md        # Common commands
    └── shortcuts.md       # Keyboard shortcuts
```

### Memory Import Patterns

```markdown
# In CLAUDE.md, import modular instructions
@~/Developer/docs/apps/patterns.md
@~/Developer/docs/tools/claude-code-power-user.md#workflow-optimization

# Maximum Recursion Depth: 5 Levels
# Keep Imports Focused And Relevant
```

## Extended Thinking

### When To Use Extended Thinking

#### Ideal Use Cases
1. **Architecture Design**: "think about the best architecture for this feature"
2. **Complex Debugging**: "think through why this error might be occurring"
3. **Performance Optimization**: "think harder about optimizing this algorithm"
4. **Security Analysis**: "think deeply about potential security vulnerabilities"
5. **API Design**: "think more about the API contract and edge cases"

#### Prompting Strategies
```markdown
# Basic Thinking (5-10 Seconds)
"think about this problem"

# Medium Thinking (10-30 Seconds)
"think harder about this"
"think more carefully"

# Deep Thinking (30+ Seconds)
"think longer about this implementation"
"think deeply about all edge cases"
"think extensively about the architecture"
```

## Extended Thinking Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: "think about database schema design" > "think about this"
2. **Chain Thinking**: Let Claude think, then refine based on output
3. **Combine with Planning**: "think about this, then create a step-by-step plan"
4. **Preserve Context**: Don't interrupt during thinking blocks

## Custom Commands

### Command Structure

#### Project Commands (.claude/commands/)
```markdown
# .claude/commands/test.md
Run comprehensive test suite with coverage

<test_command>
Run all tests with coverage reporting and open results:

```bash
pnpm test:coverage && open coverage/index.html
```
&lt;/test_command&gt;

$ARGUMENTS
```

## User Commands (~/.claude/commands/)
```markdown
# ~/.claude/commands/setup.md
Initialize new project with standard configuration

<setup_command>
Create a new project with my preferred stack:

1. Initialize with my template
2. Set up standard dependencies
3. Configure development environment
4. Create initial documentation

Project type: $ARGUMENTS
</setup_command>
```

## Power User Commands

### 1. Documentation Audit (/user:docaudit)
```bash
# Comprehensive Documentation Analysis
/user:docaudit

# With Specific Focus
/user:docaudit focus on API documentation
```

## 2. Multi-Task Planning (/user:multitask)
```bash
# Create Parallelized Implementation Plan
/user:multitask implement real-time collaboration

# With Specific Constraints
/user:multitask add authentication using Clerk
```

## 3. Performance Analysis (/project:perf)
```bash
# Analyze And Optimize Performance
/project:perf analyze bundle size

# With Specific Metrics
/project:perf optimize Core Web Vitals
```

## Workflow Optimization

### Parallel Development Pattern

Use multiple Claude Code instances with git worktrees:
```bash
# Set Up Parallel Workspaces
git worktree add ../feature-auth feature/authentication
git worktree add ../feature-api feature/api-integration

# Run Separate Claude Instances
cd ../feature-auth && claude  # Terminal 1
cd ../feature-api && claude   # Terminal 2
```

## Checkpoint-heavy Workflow

```bash
# 1. Start With Clear Intention
claude "implement user dashboard"

# 2. Checkpoint After Each Component
git add -A && git commit -m "feat: add dashboard layout"

# 3. Test Incrementally
pnpm test:watch

# 4. Easy Rollback If Needed
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

## Documentation-first Development

```markdown
# 1. Start With Docs
/user:docaudit

# 2. Create Implementation Plan From Docs
"Based on the documentation, create implementation plan"

# 3. Generate Code Matching Docs
"Implement according to the API specification"

# 4. Update Docs With Implementation Details
"Update documentation with implementation notes"
```

## Developer Docs Integration

### Structuring ~/Developer/docs/ for Claude Code

#### 1. Create Influence Templates
```markdown
# ~/Developer/docs/prompts/code/react-component.xml
<component_template>
Create a React component following these patterns:
- Use TypeScript with explicit types
- Include comprehensive JSDoc
- Implement error boundaries
- Add unit tests with React Testing Library
- Follow accessibility best practices
</component_template>
```

## 2. Reference Patterns Library
```markdown
# ~/Developer/docs/apps/patterns.md
## State Management Pattern
- Use Jotai for UI state
- Use SWR for server state
- Keep state minimal and derived

## API Pattern
- Always use error boundaries
- Implement retry logic
- Cache aggressively
```

### 3. Quick Command References
```markdown
# ~/Developer/docs/reference/commands.md
## Development Commands
- `pnpm dev` - Start all apps
- `pnpm build` - Build all packages
- `pnpm test` - Run all tests

## Database Commands
- `pnpm db:push` - Push schema changes
- `pnpm db:studio` - Open Prisma Studio
```

### Using Docs As Context

```bash
# Reference Specific Sections
@~/Developer/docs/apps/patterns.md#state-management

# Import Entire Guides
@~/Developer/docs/tools/claude-code-power-user.md

# Chain Multiple Contexts
@~/Developer/docs/apps/docs.md
@~/Developer/docs/prompts/code/react-component.xml
"Create dashboard following our patterns"
```

## Advanced Patterns

### Self-improving Documentation

```markdown
# In CLAUDE.md
## Documentation Update Protocol
- After each session, update relevant docs
- Document new patterns discovered
- Add common error solutions
- Update command shortcuts
```

### Intelligent Task Distribution

```python
# Determine Sync Vs Async Tasks
if task.requires_creativity or task.is_exploratory:
    use_claude_code()  # Async with extended thinking
elif task.is_well_defined and task.has_clear_specs:
    implement_directly()  # Sync implementation
else:
    create_plan_first()  # Plan then implement
```

## Context Window Optimization

```markdown
# Prioritize Context Loading
1. Current task requirements
2. Project-specific CLAUDE.md
3. Relevant documentation sections
4. Code examples and patterns
5. Historical context (if needed)

# Avoid Context Bloat
- Don't import entire repositories
- Reference specific sections
- Use grep/search for targeted context
```

## Verification Loops

```bash
# Self-verifying Implementation
"Implement feature X with tests"
"Run the tests and fix any failures"
"Verify edge cases are handled"
"Update documentation with examples"
```

## Team Collaboration

### Shared Standards

#### 1. Project CLAUDE.md Template
```markdown
# [Project Name]

## Team Conventions
- PR review requirements
- Commit message format
- Documentation standards

## Architecture Decisions
- [Date] - Decision and reasoning
- [Date] - Another decision

## Current Sprint Focus
- Active features
- Known blockers
- Performance targets
```

### 2. Knowledge Sharing
```bash
# Export Learnings
claude "Document the patterns we discovered"

# Share Custom Commands
cp .claude/commands/useful-command.md ~/.claude/commands/

# Update Team Documentation
"Update team docs with new patterns"
```

## Pair Programming With Claude

```markdown
# Driver Pattern
Driver: "Implement the user service"
Claude: [Implementation]
Driver: "Add error handling"
Claude: [Updates]

# Navigator Pattern
Navigator: "Review this implementation for security"
Claude: [Security analysis]
Navigator: "Fix the identified issues"
Claude: [Security fixes]
```

## Performance Tips

### 1. Response Speed Optimization
- Use specific, focused prompts
- Break complex tasks into steps
- Leverage extended thinking for planning
- Use auto-accept (Shift+Tab) for known patterns

### 2. Context Efficiency
- Keep CLAUDE.md under 1000 lines
- Use imports for modular instructions
- Clear context between unrelated tasks
- Archive outdated instructions

### 3. Workflow Automation
- Create custom commands for repetitive tasks
- Use git hooks for documentation updates
- Automate testing in development flow
- Set up continuous documentation generation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues And Solutions

#### 1. Claude Not Following Patterns
```markdown
# Solution: Be more explicit in CLAUDE.md
## Important: Always Follow These Patterns
- Specific pattern with example
- Another pattern with rationale
```

### 2. Slow Response Times
```bash
# Clear Conversation And Restart
/clear
# Use More Specific Prompts
# Break Into Smaller Tasks
```

## 3. Inconsistent Behavior
```markdown
# Add to CLAUDE.md
## Consistency Rules
- Always use these imports: [list]
- Never modify these files: [list]
- Follow this exact structure: [example]
```
