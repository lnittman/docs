## Overview

The Claude Code command system is a sophisticated AI-driven development framework that enforces architectural standards and automates complex development tasks across an entire ecosystem of projects.

## Architecture

### Component-based Design

Commands are constructed from reusable components that ensure consistency:

```xml
<components>
  <use>@thinking-blocks</use>
  <use>@session-state</use>
  <use>@xml-transformer</use>
  <use>@verification-patterns</use>
  <use>@output-standards</use>
</components>
```

### Execution Lifecycle

Every command follows a predictable lifecycle:

1. **Input Analysis** - Transform natural language to structured intent
2. **Semantic Extraction** - Extract requirements, constraints, and context  
3. **Thinking Process** - Transparent reasoning with critical evaluation
4. **Verification** - Safety checks before execution
5. **Execution** - Perform the requested operations
6. **Output** - Structured results with next steps

## Core Commands

### /user:create
Initializes a Turborepo-first project ecosystem:
- `[project]-xyz` - Monorepo (apps + packages)
  - `apps/app` - Next.js web application
  - `apps/api` - API worker (optional)
  - `apps/ai` - AI service app (preferred)
- `[project]-apple` (optional) - Native iOS/macOS app
- `[project]-docs` (optional) - Product docs (this hub remains general)

### /user:ecosystem
Meta-level operations across all projects:
- `audit` - Analyze compliance and patterns
- `standards` - Enforce architectural rules
- `evolve` - Propagate changes across projects
- `wisdom` - Extract learnings and patterns

### /user:prime
Deep analysis of specific areas with strategic recommendations.

### /user:build
Feature implementation with proper architecture and testing.

### /user:design
UI/UX development following design system patterns.

### /user:fix
Intelligent debugging and issue resolution.

### /user:vision
Creative exploration and feature ideation.

### /user:ship
Production deployment and release management.

### /user:test
Comprehensive testing strategy and implementation.

## Session Management

### State Persistence
```
.claude/session/
├── current/          # Active session state
├── archive/          # Historical sessions
└── global/           # Cross-session learnings
```

### Context Flow
Commands build on each other's outputs:
- `/create` → `/build` → `/test` → `/ship`
- Each command consumes previous context
- Intelligent next-step suggestions

## Rule Integration

Commands enforce rules from `~/.claude/rules/`:

### Enforcement Hierarchy
1. **Required** (100% adoption) - Strictly enforced
2. **Recommended** (80-99%) - Suggested with alternatives
3. **Optional** (under 80%) - Available when appropriate

### Rule Categories
- Project structure and naming
- Technology stack and versions
- Architectural patterns
- State management
- API design
- Documentation standards

## Best Practices

### Command Usage
1. Use `/user:ecosystem audit` before major changes
2. Start new projects with `/user:create`
3. Follow suggested command sequences
4. Review verification steps before confirmation

### Custom Commands
When creating custom commands:
1. Use standard components
2. Follow the execution lifecycle
3. Define interoperability
4. Document in components/

### Rule Updates
1. Base on actual patterns (80%+ adoption)
2. Focus on technical consistency
3. Allow design flexibility
4. Document rationale

## Extension Points

### Adding Components
Create reusable patterns in `components/`:
```xml
<!-- components/new-pattern.md -->
<new_pattern>
  <purpose>Describe the pattern's purpose</purpose>
  <usage>How to integrate this pattern</usage>
  <implementation>Pattern details</implementation>
</new_pattern>
```

### Custom Rules
Add domain-specific rules in `~/.claude/rules/`:
1. Document actual patterns, not ideals
2. Use clear, verifiable language
3. Specify adoption percentage
4. Include examples

## Integration Examples

### With Ides
```bash
# Vs Code Task
"tasks": [
  {
    "label": "Create Project",
    "type": "shell",
    "command": "code --execute-command 'claude-code.create ${input:projectName}'"
  }
]
```

## With CI/CD
```yaml
# Github Action
- name: Audit Standards
  run: |
    claude-code ecosystem audit all
    claude-code ecosystem standards check
```

## With Documentation
The system integrates with AI-optimized docs:
- `.docindex.json` for navigation
- `CLAUDE.md` for project context
- XML instructions for agents

## Performance Optimization

### Parallel Execution
Commands use parallel tasks where possible:
```xml
<parallel_tasks>
  <task>Structure Analysis</task>
  <task>Dependency Audit</task>
  <task>Pattern Detection</task>
</parallel_tasks>
```

### Caching
- Session state reduces redundant analysis
- Component outputs are reused
- File reads are minimized

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Command not recognizing project structure
**Solution**: Ensure you're in the correct directory (~/Developer)

**Issue**: Rules seem too restrictive
**Solution**: Rules can be adjusted based on your patterns

**Issue**: Session state conflicts
**Solution**: Clear session with `rm -rf .claude/session/current/`

### Debug Mode
Enable verbose output for troubleshooting:
```bash
CLAUDE_DEBUG=true claude-code [command]
```

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- Visual rule editor
- Automated rule discovery
- Multi-language support
- Remote team sync

### Community Extensions
The system is designed for extension:
- Share custom commands
- Contribute components
- Propose rule updates

## Conclusion

The Claude Code command system transforms AI assistance from simple code generation to intelligent, context-aware development that enforces your exact standards across an entire ecosystem. By combining structured commands, reusable components, and living rules, it enables consistent, high-quality development at scale.
