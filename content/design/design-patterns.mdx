# Design Patterns & Philosophy
**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Last Updated**: 2025-01-03  
**Purpose**: Bridge between design assets and development philosophy

## ðŸŽ¨ Design Philosophy

Our design approach is informed by masters of simplicity and functionality:

### Core Influences
- **[Dieter Rams](../inspo/dieter-rams/)** - Ten principles of good design
- **[Teenage Engineering](../inspo/te/)** - Playful minimalism
- **[John Maeda](../inspo/design-and-aesthetics/john-maeda/)** - Laws of simplicity
- **[Susan Kare](../inspo/design-and-aesthetics/susan-kare/)** - Pixel-perfect clarity

### Applied Principles
1. **Less, but better** - Remove until it breaks, then add back only essentials
2. **Honest interfaces** - UI should reveal function, not hide it
3. **Playful restraint** - Constrain to essential controls, make exploration safe
4. **Pixel precision** - Every pixel should have purpose

## ðŸŽ¯ Pattern Library

### Typography Patterns
- **Headers**: Stuart Titling for impact
- **Body**: Stuart Text for readability  
- **Code**: JetBrains Mono or system monospace
- **Accents**: CX80 for technical/futuristic elements

### Color Patterns
See [Rams on Color](../inspo/dieter-rams/color.md) for our approach to restrained color usage.

### Component Patterns
Following [Don Norman's principles](../inspo/design-and-aesthetics/don-norman/):
- Clear affordances
- Immediate feedback
- Forgiving interactions
- Consistent mental models
