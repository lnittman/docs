3. UI components and logos can be used as design references
4. All assets are organized by category for easy navigation

## File Formats

- **Fonts**: OTF, TTF, WOFF, WOFF2, EOT (web fonts)

## Contributing

When adding new design assets:
1. Organize files in appropriate subdirectories
2. Maintain consistent naming conventions
3. Avoid committing large binary files (use Git LFS if necessary)
4. Update this README when adding new categories or significant assets

## Git Lfs Recommendation

For future large assets, consider using Git LFS (Large File Storage) to manage binary files efficiently:

```bash
git lfs track "*.pdf"
git lfs track "*.psd"
git lfs track "*.ai"
```

This helps keep the repository performant while still tracking large design files.
