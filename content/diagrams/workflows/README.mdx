# Workflow Diagrams

Process flows, user journeys, and operational procedures visualized for clarity and understanding.

## Categories

### development/
Software development workflows:
- Feature development flow
- CI/CD pipelines
- Code review process
- Release procedures
- Testing workflows

### operations/
Operational and business workflows:
- Deployment procedures
- Incident response
- Monitoring workflows
- Backup procedures
- User onboarding

## Common Workflow Types

### 1. Sequential Process Flow
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Start] --> B[Step 1]
    B --> C[Step 2]
    C --> D{Decision}
    D -->|Yes| E[Action A]
    D -->|No| F[Action B]
    E --> G[End]
    F --> G
```

### 2. Swimlane Diagram
```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Developer
        D1[Write Code]
        D2[Create PR]
    end
    
    subgraph CI/CD
        C1[Run Tests]
        C2[Build]
        C3[Deploy]
    end
    
    subgraph Reviewer
        R1[Review Code]
        R2[Approve]
    end
    
    D1 --> D2
    D2 --> R1
    R1 --> R2
    R2 --> C1
    C1 --> C2
    C2 --> C3
```

### 3. State Machine
```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Draft
    Draft --> InReview : Submit
    InReview --> Approved : Approve
    InReview --> Draft : Request Changes
    Approved --> Published : Publish
    Published --> [*]
```

## Creating Workflow Diagrams

```bash
# Development Workflow
/user:diagram development workflow for feature releases

# User Journey
/user:diagram user journey for onboarding process

# Operational Procedure
/user:diagram deployment procedure for production
```

## Best Practices

1. **Clear Start/End**: Mark beginning and end points
2. **Decision Points**: Clearly show branches
3. **Actor Identification**: Show who performs each step
4. **Time Indicators**: Add duration where relevant
5. **Error Paths**: Include failure scenarios
