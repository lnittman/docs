# Architecture Diagrams

System and application architecture visualizations that show the structure, components, and relationships within projects.

## Categories

### high-level/
System-wide architecture diagrams showing:
- Overall system architecture
- Service boundaries
- External integrations
- Technology stack overview

### data-flow/
Data movement and transformation diagrams showing:
- API request/response flows
- Event-driven architectures
- Data pipelines
- Message queue flows

### component/
Detailed component architecture showing:
- Internal module structure
- Package dependencies
- Class hierarchies
- Interface relationships

## Naming Convention

`[project]-[scope]-[type]-[version].md`

Examples:
- `webs-system-overview-v1.md`
- `arbor-data-flow-auth.md`
- `shared-component-hierarchy.md`

## Example: System Overview

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Client Layer"
        Web[Web App<br/>Next.js]
        Mobile[iOS App<br/>Swift]
    end
    
    subgraph "API Layer"
        Gateway[API Gateway]
        Auth[Auth Service]
        Core[Core API]
    end
    
    subgraph "Service Layer"
        AI[AI Service<br/>Mastra]
        Worker[Background Jobs]
    end
    
    subgraph "Data Layer"
        DB[(PostgreSQL)]
        Cache[(Redis)]
        Storage[Object Storage]
    end
    
    Web --> Gateway
    Mobile --> Gateway
    Gateway --> Auth
    Gateway --> Core
    Core --> AI
    Core --> Worker
    Core --> DB
    Core --> Cache
    AI --> Storage
```

## Creating Architecture Diagrams

```bash
# Create System Overview
/user:diagram architecture overview for [project]

# Create Data Flow
/user:diagram data flow for [feature] in [project]

# Create Component Diagram
/user:diagram component structure for [package]
```

## Best Practices

1. **Layer Separation**: Clearly show architectural layers
2. **Boundary Definition**: Mark service/module boundaries
3. **Direction Flow**: Use consistent arrow directions
4. **Technology Labels**: Include tech stack information
5. **Version Tracking**: Update version numbers with changes
