**Last Updated**: 2025-01-03  
**Purpose**: Ready-to-use prompts incorporating design philosophy

## üéØ Overview

These prompt snippets integrate wisdom from design masters and software architects. Use them in your `~/.claude/commands` or directly in conversations.

## üìù Universal Design Prompts

### The Simplicity Audit
```markdown
Apply Maeda's Laws of Simplicity and Rams' "Less but better" principle:
1. What can be removed without losing functionality?
2. What can be combined or consolidated?
3. What complexity is actually necessary?
4. How can we make the essential parts more obvious?
```

### The Human-centered Review
```markdown
Following Don Norman's principles:
- What affordances are we providing?
- How does the system communicate its state?
- What errors are we preventing vs. handling?
- Where might users form incorrect mental models?
```

### The Systems Thinking Analysis
```markdown
Channel Buckminster Fuller's holistic approach:
- What are the interconnections we're not seeing?
- How can we do more with less (ephemeralization)?
- What patterns emerge at the system level?
- Where are the leverage points for maximum impact?
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Prompts

### The Evolutionary Architecture
```markdown
Using Martin Fowler's evolutionary architecture principles:
1. Identify the dimensions of change
2. Define fitness functions for each dimension
3. Plan incremental steps toward the target
4. Build in feedback loops for continuous improvement
```

### The Xp Design Session
```markdown
Apply Kent Beck's Extreme Programming values:
- Simplicity: What's the simplest thing that could work?
- Communication: How does this design communicate intent?
- Feedback: How quickly will we know if this works?
- Courage: What refactoring are we avoiding?
- Respect: How does this respect team and user needs?
```

### The Strategic Mapping
```markdown
Create a Wardley Map for this system:
1. Identify user needs at the top
2. Map the value chain vertically
3. Position components on the evolution axis
4. Identify strategic moves and gameplay

```

## ü§ñ AI Development Prompts

### The Software 2.0 Transformation
```markdown
Following Karpathy's Software 2.0 paradigm:
- Which behaviors should be learned vs. programmed?
- What training data would teach this behavior?
- How do we maintain interpretability?
- Where do we need human oversight?
```

### The Straightforward Agent
```markdown
Design with Mastra's transparency principles:
1. Make every operation explicit and traceable
2. Use simple, composable functions
3. Avoid hidden state and magic
4. Provide clear debugging visibility
```

### The Incremental AI Feature
```markdown
Apply Vercel AI SDK's "Start Small, Then Scale":
- MVP: What's the minimal AI feature that provides value?
- Enhancement: How can we add streaming for better UX?
- Scale: What needs optimization for production?
- Future-proof: How do we stay provider-agnostic?
```

## üé® Design Philosophy Mashups

### Rams √ó Karpathy
```markdown
Design this AI system with Rams' clarity:
- Every model output should have a clear purpose
- The interface should be honest about AI limitations
- Remove any AI features that don't improve user outcomes
- Make the system's confidence visible and understandable
```

### Teenage Engineering √ó Mastra
```markdown
Build an AI agent that's playful yet powerful:
- Constrain the interface to essential controls
- Make exploration feel safe and fun
- Use visual/audio feedback for agent states
- Keep the technical complexity hidden but accessible
```

### Norman √ó Fowler
```markdown
Create an architecture that's both human-centered and evolvable:
- Design APIs that match user mental models
- Build in affordances at the code level
- Create fitness functions for usability metrics
- Evolve based on actual usage patterns
```

## üíª Command Integration

### For ~/.claude/commands/simplify.md
```markdown
# Simplify With Design Masters

Apply simplification principles from multiple perspectives.

@~/Developer/docs/inspo/design-and-aesthetics/john-maeda/
@~/Developer/docs/inspo/dieter-rams/

Simplify this $SELECTION using:
1. Maeda's Laws (Reduce, Organize, Time, Learn, Differences, Context)
2. Rams' Principle #3 (Less, but better)
3. Focus on essential functionality
4. Remove decorative complexity
```

### For ~/.claude/commands/architect.md
```markdown
# Architect With Proven Patterns

Design using battle-tested architectural principles.

@~/Developer/docs/inspo/software-architecture/martin-fowler/
@~/Developer/docs/inspo/software-architecture/kent-beck/

Architect this $SELECTION following:
1. Fowler's evolutionary architecture patterns
2. Beck's simple design rules
3. Clear boundaries and interfaces
4. Testability as a first-class concern
```

### For ~/.claude/commands/ai-enhance.md
```markdown
# Enhance With AI Thoughtfully

Add AI capabilities following best practices.

@~/Developer/docs/inspo/ai-and-modern-development/andrej-karpathy/
@~/Developer/docs/inspo/ai-and-modern-development/vercel-ai/
@~/Developer/docs/inspo/ai-and-modern-development/mastra-team/

Enhance $SELECTION with AI by:
1. Identifying Software 2.0 opportunities (Karpathy)
2. Starting small with Vercel AI SDK patterns
3. Keeping it straightforward (Mastra philosophy)
4. Maintaining human oversight and interpretability
```

## üîÑ Composite Patterns

### The Full Stack Philosophy Review
```markdown
Review this full-stack application through multiple lenses:

DESIGN (Rams, Maeda, Norman):
- Is the UI honest and unobtrusive?
- Have we simplified to the essence?
- Are interactions human-centered?

ARCHITECTURE (Fowler, Beck, Wardley):
- Is the architecture evolvable?
- Have we applied simple design?
- Where are we on the evolution curve?

AI INTEGRATION (Karpathy, Mastra, Vercel):
- Which parts benefit from Software 2.0?
- Is our implementation transparent?
- Can we scale incrementally?

SYSTEM THINKING (Fuller, Procida):
- How do parts create emergent properties?
- Is our documentation complete (all 4 quadrants)?
```

## üéØ Quick Reference

### When To Use Each Philosophy

**Starting a New Project**
- Wardley: Map the landscape first
- Beck: Start with the simplest thing
- Vercel AI: Build incrementally

**Refactoring Existing Code**
- Fowler: Identify seams and boundaries
- Maeda: Apply laws of simplicity
- Rams: Remove until it breaks, then add back

**Adding AI Features**
- Karpathy: Evaluate Software 1.0 vs 2.0
- Mastra: Keep it transparent
- Vercel: Start small, use streaming

**Improving User Experience**
- Norman: Focus on affordances and feedback
- Kare: Pixel-perfect clarity
- Teenage Engineering: Playful minimalism

**Documentation**
- Procida: Use all four quadrants
- Fuller: Show system connections
- Ive: Document the "why" behind decisions
