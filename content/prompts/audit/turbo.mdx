i would like you to comprehensively audit the current state of all repos in concurrent tasks. what is the state of completion relative to our docs/? how complete and well integrated is the  turborepo? be completely thorough, review all files and their integration points to document our current state in complete clarity. use context7 as needed to pull in context on dependencies. your output is a singular document with all findings, including your recommendations for next steps including code references and implementation snippets. use ULTRATHINK throughout the task. do not stop researching / deep diving until you have the complete comprehensive picture of the repos and what their respective and holistic current states are.
