# Inspiration & Philosophy Reference
**Version**: 1.0.0  
## Table Of Contents

<!-- Generated placeholder; add anchors as needed -->

**Last Updated**: 2025-01-03  
**Purpose**: Cross-disciplinary wisdom for AI-assisted development

## 🎯 Overview

This directory contains curated insights from design masters, systems thinkers, software architects, and AI pioneers. Each reference is optimized for use in Claude commands and development prompts.

## 🏗️ Structure

### Design & Aesthetics
- **[Dieter Rams](./dieter-rams/)** - Ten principles of good design, "less but better"
- **[Teenage Engineering](./te/)** - Playful minimalism, constraint-driven creativity
- **[John Maeda](./design-and-aesthetics/john-maeda/)** - Laws of simplicity, design + technology
- **[Susan Kare](./design-and-aesthetics/susan-kare/)** - Pixel-perfect iconography, visual clarity
- **[Jony Ive](./design-and-aesthetics/jony-ive/)** - Hardware-software unity, material honesty
- **[Don Norman](./design-and-aesthetics/don-norman/)** - Human-centered design, affordances
- **[Buckminster Fuller](./design-and-aesthetics/buckminster-fuller/)** - Systems thinking, Spaceship Earth

### Systems & Strategy
- **[Simon Wardley](./systems-and-strategy/simon-wardley/)** - Wardley mapping, strategic evolution

### Software Architecture
- **[Martin Fowler](./software-architecture/martin-fowler/)** - Microservices, evolutionary architecture
- **[Kent Beck](./software-architecture/kent-beck/)** - Extreme programming, test-driven development
- **[Daniele Procida](./software-architecture/daniele-procida/)** - Diátaxis documentation framework

### AI & Modern Development
- **[Andrej Karpathy](./ai-and-modern-development/andrej-karpathy/)** - Software 2.0, neural networks
- **[Mastra Team](./ai-and-modern-development/mastra-team/)** - Straightforward AI agents, TypeScript-first
- **[Vercel AI](./ai-and-modern-development/vercel-ai/)** - AI SDK patterns, edge-ready AI

## 📚 Usage In Prompts

### Quick Reference Snippets
```markdown
# Design Decisions
"Apply Rams' principle #3 (less, but better) and Maeda's Law of Reduction"

# Architecture Choices
"Structure this following Fowler's bounded contexts and Beck's simple design"

# Documentation
"Organize docs using Procida's four quadrants: tutorial, how-to, reference, explanation"

# AI Implementation
"Follow Karpathy's Software 2.0 principles and Mastra's straightforward approach"

# Strategic Planning
"Create a Wardley Map showing evolution from genesis to commodity"
```

## In Claude Commands
```bash
# Reference Specific Philosophies
@~/Developer/docs/inspo/dieter-rams/
"Design this interface following Rams' principles"

# Combine Multiple Perspectives
@~/Developer/docs/inspo/design-and-aesthetics/john-maeda/
@~/Developer/docs/inspo/ai-and-modern-development/mastra-team/
"Create a simple yet powerful AI agent interface"
```

## 🔮 Living Philosophy

This inspiration directory grows with each project. When you discover new patterns or thinkers that resonate, add them here. The goal is a rich tapestry of wisdom that makes every AI-assisted development session more thoughtful and effective.
