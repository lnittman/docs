## Overview Of Wardley Mapping And Strategic Thinking

Wardley Mapping is a strategic planning technique developed by Simon Wardley that helps organizations visualize their value chains and understand the evolution of their components. It combines situational awareness with movement patterns to enable better strategic decision-making.

### Core Principles

1. **Purpose**: Understanding user needs and defining clear organizational purpose
2. **Landscape**: Mapping the competitive environment and value chains
3. **Climate**: Recognizing patterns of change and evolution
4. **Doctrine**: Universal principles of good operations
5. **Leadership**: Context-specific strategic choices

### Why Wardley Mapping Matters

- **Visual Communication**: Makes strategy visible and debatable
- **Situational Awareness**: Understand where you are before deciding where to go
- **Evolution Understanding**: Recognize how components naturally evolve
- **Strategic Gameplay**: Anticipate competitor moves and market changes
- **Technology Decisions**: Make informed choices about build vs. buy vs. outsource

## The Evolution Axis: Genesis → Custom → Product → Commodity

The evolution axis is fundamental to Wardley Mapping. All components evolve through predictable stages:

### 1. Genesis (Novel/Experimental)
- **Characteristics**: Rare, poorly understood, experimental
- **Properties**: Expensive, unreliable, requires specialists
- **Examples**: Early AI research, quantum computing experiments
- **Strategy**: Exploration, R&D, accepting failure

### 2. Custom-built (Emerging)
- **Characteristics**: Uncommon, requires expertise, bespoke solutions
- **Properties**: Very expensive, somewhat reliable, crafted by experts
- **Examples**: Custom ML models, specialized enterprise software
- **Strategy**: Differentiation, competitive advantage, learning

### 3. Product (Good Enough)
- **Characteristics**: Increasingly common, feature competition, versions
- **Properties**: Moderately expensive, reliable, documented
- **Examples**: SaaS platforms, databases, frameworks
- **Strategy**: Feature optimization, market competition, scaling

### 4. Commodity/Utility (Standardized)
- **Characteristics**: Ubiquitous, standardized, expected
- **Properties**: Cheap, highly reliable, invisible
- **Examples**: Cloud computing (AWS/Azure), electricity, internet
- **Strategy**: Operational efficiency, cost optimization, volume

### Evolution Characteristics Table

| Stage | Genesis | Custom | Product | Commodity |
|-------|---------|---------|----------|-----------|
| **Ubiquity** | Rare | Uncommon | Common | Ubiquitous |
| **Certainty** | Poorly understood | Emerging understanding | Well understood | Standardized |
| **Market** | Undefined | Forming | Competitive | Utility |
| **Focus** | Innovation | Building | Features | Operations |
| **Failure** | High tolerance | Moderate tolerance | Low tolerance | No tolerance |
| **Characteristics** | Chaotic | Divergent | Convergent | Stable |

## How To Create And Use Wardley Maps For Technical Decisions

### Step-by-step Guide To Creating A Wardley Map

#### 1. Identify The User Need
- Start with a clear user need (top of the map)
- Be specific: "Stream video content" not "entertainment"

#### 2. Identify Components In The Value Chain
- List all components needed to meet the user need
- Work backwards from user need to underlying components
- Include both visible and invisible components

#### 3. Position On Evolution Axis (X-Axis)
- Place each component based on its evolution stage
- Consider: ubiquity, certainty, and standardization
- Be honest about current state, not desired state

#### 4. Position On Value Chain (Y-Axis)
- Components closer to user at top
- Infrastructure and dependencies at bottom
- Show connections between components

#### 5. Add Movement
- Show how components are evolving (arrows)
- Identify areas of rapid change
- Consider competitive movements

### Example: Mapping A Modern Web Application

```
User Need: Online Shopping Experience
│
├─ Web Interface (Product → Commodity)
│   ├─ React Framework (Product)
│   └─ Design System (Custom → Product)
│
├─ API Gateway (Product)
│   ├─ Authentication (Product → Commodity)
│   └─ Rate Limiting (Commodity)
│
├─ Business Logic (Custom)
│   ├─ Recommendation Engine (Custom → Product)
│   └─ Inventory Management (Product)
│
├─ Data Layer
│   ├─ PostgreSQL (Commodity)
│   ├─ Redis Cache (Commodity)
│   └─ Analytics Pipeline (Custom → Product)
│
└─ Infrastructure
    ├─ Cloud Hosting (Commodity)
    ├─ CDN (Commodity)
    └─ Monitoring (Product → Commodity)
```

### Using Maps For Technical Decisions

#### Build Vs Buy Analysis
- **Genesis/Custom**: Usually build (no alternatives exist)
- **Product**: Evaluate build vs buy based on differentiation
- **Commodity**: Always buy/rent unless strategic reason

#### Technology Selection Framework
1. Map current technology landscape
2. Identify evolution trajectories
3. Avoid investing in soon-to-be commodities
4. Focus innovation on genesis/custom areas
5. Standardize on commodities

#### Risk Assessment
- **Evolution Risk**: Components moving to commodity
- **Dependency Risk**: Relying on genesis-stage components
- **Competitive Risk**: Competitors using more evolved components
- **Technical Debt**: Custom-built commodities

## Strategic Patterns And Gameplay

### Common Strategic Patterns

#### 1. Commoditization Play
- Accelerate evolution of competitor's differentiator
- Example: Open-sourcing similar technology
- Counter: Move up the value chain

#### 2. Tower And Moat
- Build on commodity base (tower)
- Create custom differentiation (moat)
- Example: Netflix on AWS with custom recommendation engine

#### 3. Ecosystem Play
- Create platform others build upon
- Accelerate ecosystem evolution
- Example: AWS, Salesforce platform

#### 4. Pioneer-settler-town Planner
- **Pioneers**: Explore genesis innovations
- **Settlers**: Turn innovations into products
- **Town Planners**: Industrialize into commodities
- Requires different skills and metrics

### Weak Signal Detection

| Signal Type | Indicators | Action |
|------------|------------|---------|
| **Commoditization** | Multiple vendors, standards emerging | Prepare to migrate |
| **Disruption** | New practice replacing product | Evaluate early adoption |
| **Inertia** | Resistance to commodity adoption | Opportunity for advantage |
| **Co-evolution** | Multiple components evolving together | System-level thinking |

### Doctrine: Universal Principles

1. **Phase-appropriate methods**: Agile for genesis, Lean for product, Six Sigma for commodity
2. **Remove bias and duplication**: One source of truth
3. **Use appropriate tools**: Match methods to evolution stage
4. **Think small teams**: Two-pizza rule for innovation
5. **Design for constant evolution**: Everything changes
