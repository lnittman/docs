# Welcome To The Developer Documentation Hub

This is your centralized knowledge base optimized for use with Claude Code and other AI development tools. It contains reusable prompts, documentation standards, tool guides, and project patterns.

## Key Resources

### [Architecture Standards](/architecture/standards)
Overall architectural guidelines, technology stack specifications, and development workflow standards

### [Claude Code Guide](/tools/anthropic/claude-code)
Comprehensive guide to using Claude Code effectively for development

### [Design System](/design/README)
Design assets, patterns, and typography collection

### [Prompt Library](/prompts-showcase)
Reusable prompt templates for code, documentation, and AI integration

## Quick Start

### For Claude Code Users

#### 1. Reference in CLAUDE.md
Import documentation standards in your project's CLAUDE.md:
```markdown
# Import documentation standards
@~/Developer/docs/architecture/standards.mdx

# Import specific patterns
@~/Developer/docs/architecture/patterns.mdx#state-management
```

#### 2. Use in Commands
Reference documentation directly in commands:
```bash
# Reference documentation
@~/Developer/docs/prompts/code/code-review.xml
"Review this implementation"
```

#### 3. Create Custom Commands
Build custom commands that reference docs:
```bash
# Reference docs in custom commands
cat > ~/.claude/commands/standards.md << 'EOF'
# Apply Documentation Standards

Apply our documentation standards to the current project.

@~/Developer/docs/apps/docs.md

$ARGUMENTS
EOF
```
