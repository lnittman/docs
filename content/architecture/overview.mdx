## Standards Hierarchy

### 1. STANDARDS.md
Location: `~/Developer/STANDARDS.md`

High-level architectural guidelines covering:
- Product layout and repository structure
- Technology stack decisions
- Development workflow
- Quality standards

### 2. Claude Code Rules
Location: `~/.claude/rules/`

Detailed implementation rules enforced by AI commands:
- Based on actual patterns (80%+ adoption across projects)
- Programmatically verifiable
- Focused on technical consistency, not aesthetic choices
- Living documentation that evolves with the ecosystem

### 3. Claude Code Commands
Location: `~/.claude/commands/`

AI-driven development commands that:
- Enforce the standards and rules automatically
- Provide consistent project initialization
- Enable ecosystem-wide operations
- Build on each other with context awareness

## How They Work Together

```
STANDARDS.md (Vision)
    ↓
Rules (Specification)  
    ↓
Commands (Execution)
    ↓
Projects (Reality)
```

### Example Flow

1. **Standard**: "Products use a Turborepo with `apps/app`, `apps/api` (optional), and `apps/ai` (preferred)"
2. **Rules**: Detailed specifications for monorepo structure and packages
3. **Command**: `/user:create` initializes the monorepo structure
4. **Result**: Consistent project structure with zero manual configuration

## Key Principles

### 1. Reality-based
- Standards derived from what actually works in production
- Not theoretical ideals or aspirational patterns
- Validated by 80%+ adoption across projects

### 2. Flexibility Where Appropriate
- **Strict** on structure and core tools (100% adoption)
- **Flexible** on implementation details (varying adoption)
- **Open** on design and creative choices

### 3. Automated Enforcement
- Commands handle the complexity
- Developers focus on features, not configuration
- Standards are applied consistently without manual effort

## Practical Usage

### Starting A New Project
```bash
# In ~/Developer directory
/user:create "AI-powered recipe manager"
```
This automatically:
- Creates 4 properly structured repositories
- Installs all standard dependencies
- Configures authentication, database, and UI
- Sets up CI/CD patterns
- Generates documentation structure

## Auditing Existing Projects
```bash
/user:ecosystem audit all
```
This provides:
- Compliance scores against standards
- Pattern analysis across projects
- Recommendations for improvements
- Migration paths for updates

### Propagating Changes
```bash
/user:ecosystem evolve "upgrade to Next.js 15.1"
```
This handles:
- Identifying affected projects
- Creating update branches
- Running tests
- Generating pull requests

## Maintenance

### Updating Standards
1. Observe emerging patterns across projects
2. When pattern reaches 80% adoption, document it
3. Update relevant rule files
4. Enhance commands to enforce new patterns
5. Run ecosystem audit to assess impact

### Version Management
- Framework versions specified with minimum requirements
- Update strategy defined in version_guidelines.md
- Coordinated updates across ecosystem
- Breaking changes documented and managed

## Benefits

### For Developers
- Zero configuration setup
- Consistent patterns across projects
- Focus on features, not infrastructure
- Intelligent assistance that understands context

### For Teams
- Reduced onboarding time
- Consistent code across developers
- Automated quality enforcement
- Living documentation that stays current

### For Products
- Faster time to market
- Consistent user experience
- Reliable deployment patterns
- Scalable architecture from day one

## Next Steps

1. **Review** existing projects with `/user:ecosystem audit`
2. **Create** new projects with `/user:create`
3. **Explore** the command system documentation
4. **Contribute** patterns that achieve 80%+ adoption

The standards, rules, and commands form a complete system for maintaining consistency and quality across an entire development ecosystem while preserving flexibility where it matters most.
