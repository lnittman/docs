# Evolution Roadmap

> Strategic plan for ecosystem improvements and cross-project propagation

## üöÄ Evolution Strategy

### Vision
Transform the developer ecosystem into a self-improving system where patterns propagate automatically, standards enforce themselves, and collective wisdom accelerates development.

### Principles
1. **Incremental Progress** - Small, safe changes over big rewrites
2. **Automation First** - Reduce manual effort through tooling
3. **Pattern Recognition** - Extract and propagate successful patterns
4. **Backwards Compatible** - Never break existing functionality
5. **Developer Experience** - Make the right thing the easy thing

## üìÖ Roadmap Overview

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2) üèóÔ∏è
**Goal**: Achieve baseline compliance and security

- [ ] Fix all critical security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Update Mastra to 0.10.10 across all projects
- [ ] Align Next.js versions to 15.3.4
- [ ] Generate missing documentation
- [ ] Set up automated compliance checking

### Phase 2: Standardization (Weeks 3-4) üìè
**Goal**: Bring all projects to standard structure

- [ ] Complete Alden migration
- [ ] Add missing Apple components
- [ ] Standardize package structures
- [ ] Consolidate development configs
- [ ] Create shared component libraries

### Phase 3: Intelligence (Weeks 5-8) üß†
**Goal**: Build self-improving capabilities

- [ ] Automated pattern extraction
- [ ] Cross-project propagation system
- [ ] AI-assisted code generation
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Advanced monitoring

### Phase 4: Scale (Weeks 9-12) üìà
**Goal**: Ecosystem-wide improvements

- [ ] Micro-frontend architecture
- [ ] Shared design system
- [ ] Unified API gateway
- [ ] Cross-platform code sharing
- [ ] Advanced CI/CD pipelines

## üéØ Immediate Actions (Week 1)

### Day 1-2: Security & Updates
```bash
# Run security audit
/user:ecosystem audit security all

# Fix critical vulnerabilities
pnpm audit fix --production -r

# Update Mastra framework
/user:ecosystem evolve "mastra@0.10.10"
```

### Day 3-4: Version Alignment
```bash
# Update Next.js
/user:ecosystem evolve "next@15.3.4"

# Align TypeScript configs
/user:ecosystem standards fix typescript

# Update development tools
/user:ecosystem evolve "dev-tools"
```

### Day 5-7: Documentation
```bash
# Generate missing CLAUDE.md
/user:ecosystem standards fix docs

# Create API documentation
/user:ecosystem wisdom extract api-patterns

# Update project READMEs
/user:ecosystem standards fix readme
```

## üîÑ Evolution Patterns

### 1. Dependency Evolution Pattern
```yaml
Pattern: Rolling Updates
Steps:
  1. Update in smallest project first
  2. Test thoroughly
  3. Extract learnings
  4. Apply to similar projects
  5. Finally update critical projects

Example: Mastra 0.10.8 ‚Üí 0.10.10
  - Start: sine-ai (experimental)
  - Test: 2 days validation
  - Propagate: All AI services
  - Complete: 1 week total
```

### 2. Structure Evolution Pattern
```yaml
Pattern: Incremental Migration
Steps:
  1. Create new structure alongside old
  2. Move components gradually
  3. Update imports incrementally
  4. Validate at each step
  5. Remove old structure

Example: Alden Migration
  - Week 1: Create new repos
  - Week 2: Move core features
  - Week 3: Complete migration
  - Week 4: Archive old structure
```

### 3. Feature Evolution Pattern
```yaml
Pattern: Cross-Pollination
Steps:
  1. Identify successful feature
  2. Extract as shared package
  3. Generalize for reuse
  4. Document patterns
  5. Propagate to projects

Example: Auth System
  - Source: Kumori (Clerk + Prisma)
  - Extract: packages/auth
  - Generalize: Multi-provider
  - Propagate: All projects
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Evolution Tools

### Automated Scripts

```bash
# Propagate package updates
./evolution/scripts/propagate-updates.sh

# Migrate project structure
./evolution/scripts/migrate-structure.sh [project]

# Extract shared patterns
./evolution/scripts/extract-patterns.sh

# Generate evolution report
./evolution/scripts/evolution-report.sh
```

### Manual Processes

1. **Architecture Reviews**
   - Weekly ecosystem architecture review
   - Identify divergences and opportunities
   - Document decisions

2. **Pattern Mining**
   - Monthly pattern extraction session
   - Analyze successful implementations
   - Create reusable templates

3. **Performance Analysis**
   - Quarterly performance audit
   - Identify bottlenecks
   - Propagate optimizations

## üìä Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Targets
- 0 security vulnerabilities
- 100% on Mastra 0.10.10
- 95% on Next.js 15.3.4
- 90% documentation coverage

### Phase 2 Targets
- 85% compliance score
- 0 non-standard structures
- 5 shared packages created
- 80% test coverage

### Phase 3 Targets
