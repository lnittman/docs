# Claude Command Center Enhancement Guide
**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Last Updated**: 2025-01-02  
**Purpose**: Transform individual commands into a cohesive, interoperable command center

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

Your `~/.claude/commands/` directory is evolving into a powerful command center where each command:
- Accepts any input type (URLs, pasted content, screenshots)
- Passes context to other commands
- Builds on previous work
- Executes in parallel when possible

## ðŸ”§ Universal Enhancements for All Commands

### 1. Input Handler Pattern

Add this to the beginning of each command's processing phase:

```markdown
<universal_input_handler>
Process $ARGUMENTS to detect and handle:

**URLs Detected:**
- Use WebFetch to get content
- Extract relevant patterns/documentation
- Parse for implementation examples

**Code Blocks Detected:**
- Parse language and purpose
- Adapt to current project style
- Extract patterns

**File Paths Detected:**
- Read files directly
- Understand context
- Extract relevant sections

**Screenshots/Images Detected:**
- Analyze UI patterns
- Extract design elements
- Understand user intent

**Mixed Content:**
- Separate into categories
- Process each appropriately
- Combine insights
</universal_input_handler>
```

### 2. Context Output Pattern

Add this to each command's output:

```markdown
<context_output>
## ðŸ”— Command Context
**Command**: /user:[command]
**Timestamp**: [ISO timestamp]
**Key Findings**: 
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]

**For Next Commands**:
```json
{
  "command": "[command-name]",
  "findings": {
    "key": "value"
  },
  "suggestions": [
    "/user:build implement [feature]",
    "/user:design enhance [component]"
  ]
}
```
</context_output>

### 3. Session Memory Pattern

Each command should check for and update session memory:

```markdown
<session_memory>
# Check for existing session
if exists .claude/session/current/:
  - Load previous_commands.json
  - Load accumulated_context.json
  - Build on existing knowledge

# Update session
- Add command results to session
- Update accumulated context
- Save for next command
</session_memory>
```

## ðŸ“‹ Command-Specific Enhancements

## ðŸš€ Usage Patterns

### Pattern 1: Full Project Flow
```bash
# 1. Start with an idea + reference
/user:create social app like BeReal but for developers [paste BeReal article URL]

# 2. Explore creative possibilities
/user:vision [paste AI UI examples URLs]

# 3. Design the system
/user:design [paste component library URL]

# 4. Build iteratively
/user:build implement auth [paste Clerk docs URL]
/user:build add main feature
/user:build integrate AI [paste Mastra examples]

# 5. Prepare for launch
/user:brand [paste competitor analysis]

# 6. Document everything
/user:docaudit
```

### Pattern 2: Quick Feature Addition
```bash
# 1. Get context
/user:prime focus on payments

# 2. Build with reference
/user:build add Stripe [paste Stripe docs URL]
```

### Pattern 3: Design-Driven Development
```bash
# 1. Design first
/user:design [paste Figma URL]

# 2. Build components
/user:build implement design system

# 3. Document patterns
/user:docaudit focus on components
```

## ðŸ’¾ Session Continuity

### Session Structure
```
.claude/session/current/
â”œâ”€â”€ metadata.json           # Session start time, commands run
â”œâ”€â”€ project_context.json    # Accumulated understanding
â”œâ”€â”€ command_history.md      # What each command did
â”œâ”€â”€ findings/              # Key discoveries
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ prime.json
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ create.json
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â””â”€â”€ deliverables/          # Generated artifacts
    â”œâ”€â”€ plans/
    â”œâ”€â”€ designs/
    â””â”€â”€ docs/
```

### Context Passing Example
```json
{
  "from_command": "create",
  "to_command": "build",
  "context": {
    "project_name": "social-dev-app",
    "tech_stack": {
      "frontend": "Next.js 15",
      "backend": "Supabase",
      "ai": "Mastra"
    },
    "phase": "implementation",
    "next_task": "Setup authentication"
  }
}
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Best Practices

### 1. Start with Prime
Always begin sessions with `/user:prime` to establish context

### 2. Use URLs Liberally
```bash
# Good
/user:build add charts [paste D3.js examples URL]

# Better  
/user:build add charts [paste D3 docs] [paste example] [paste our design]
```

### 3. Chain Commands Naturally
Let each command suggest the next logical step

### 4. Iterate with Build
```bash
/user:build â†’ test â†’ /user:build fix â†’ test â†’ /user:build enhance
```

### 5. Document as You Go
Run `/user:docaudit` periodically, not just at the end

## ðŸ”® Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Auto-chaining**: Commands automatically trigger next steps
2. **Parallel execution**: Multiple commands run simultaneously  
3. **Smart caching**: Reuse expensive operations
4. **Visual feedback**: Progress indicators for long operations
5. **Command macros**: Bundle common sequences

### Integration Ideas
1. **Git hooks**: Auto-run commands on commits
2. **CI/CD**: Commands in deployment pipeline
3. **IDE integration**: Commands from VS Code
4. **Team sharing**: Shared command patterns
5. **Analytics**: Track command usage patterns
