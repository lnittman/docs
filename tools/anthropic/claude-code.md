Custom notification hooks
For advanced notification handling, you can create notification hooks to run your own logic.

​
Handling large inputs
When working with extensive code or long instructions:

Avoid direct pasting: Claude Code may struggle with very long pasted content
Use file-based workflows: Write content to a file and ask Claude to read it
Be aware of VS Code limitations: The VS Code terminal is particularly prone to truncating long pastes

# Quickstart

> Welcome to Claude Code!

This quickstart guide will have you using AI-powered coding assistance in just a few minutes. By the end, you'll understand how to use Claude Code for common development tasks.

## Before you begin

Make sure you have:

* [Installed Claude Code](/en/docs/claude-code/setup)
* A terminal or command prompt open
* A code project to work with

## Step 1: Start your first session

Open your terminal in any project directory and start Claude Code:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
claude
```

You'll see the Claude Code prompt inside a new interactive session:

```
✻ Welcome to Claude Code!

...

> Try "create a util logging.py that..." 
```

## Step 2: Ask your first question

Let's start with understanding your codebase. Try one of these commands:

```
> what does this project do?
```

Claude will analyze your files and provide a summary. You can also ask more specific questions:

```
> what technologies does this project use?
```

```
> where is the main entry point?
```

```
> explain the folder structure
```

<Note>
  Claude Code reads your files as needed - you don't have to manually add context.
</Note>

## Step 3: Make your first code change

Now let's make Claude Code do some actual coding. Try a simple task:

```
> add a hello world function to the main file
```

Claude Code will:

1. Find the appropriate file
2. Show you the proposed changes
3. Ask for your approval
4. Make the edit

<Note>
  Claude Code always asks for permission before modifying files. You can approve individual changes or enable "Accept all" mode for a session.
</Note>

## Step 4: Use Git with Claude Code

Claude Code makes Git operations conversational:

```
> what files have I changed?
```

```
> commit my changes with a descriptive message
```

You can also prompt for more complex Git operations:

```
> create a new branch called feature/quickstart
```

```
> show me the last 5 commits
```

```
> help me resolve merge conflicts
```

## Step 5: Fix a bug or add a feature

Claude is proficient at debugging and feature implementation.

Describe what you want in natural language:

```
> add input validation to the user registration form
```

Or fix existing issues:

```
> there's a bug where users can submit empty forms - fix it
```

Claude Code will:

* Locate the relevant code
* Understand the context
* Implement a solution
* Run tests if available

## Step 6: Test out other common workflows

There are a number of ways to work with Claude:

**Refactor code**

```
> refactor the authentication module to use async/await instead of callbacks
```

**Write tests**

```
> write unit tests for the calculator functions
```

**Update documentation**

```
> update the README with installation instructions
```

**Code review**

```
> review my changes and suggest improvements
```

<Tip>
  **Remember**: Claude Code is your AI pair programmer. Talk to it like you would a helpful colleague - describe what you want to achieve, and it will help you get there.
</Tip>

# Manage Claude's memory

> Learn how to manage Claude Code's memory across sessions with different memory locations and best practices.

Claude Code can remember your preferences across sessions, like style guidelines and common commands in your workflow.

## Determine memory type

Claude Code offers three memory locations, each serving a different purpose:

| Memory Type                | Location              | Purpose                                  | Use Case Examples                                                |
| -------------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Project memory**         | `./CLAUDE.md`         | Team-shared instructions for the project | Project architecture, coding standards, common workflows         |
| **User memory**            | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | Personal preferences for all projects    | Code styling preferences, personal tooling shortcuts             |
| **Project memory (local)** | `./CLAUDE.local.md`   | Personal project-specific preferences    | *(Deprecated, see below)* Your sandbox URLs, preferred test data |

All memory files are automatically loaded into Claude Code's context when launched.

## CLAUDE.md imports

CLAUDE.md files can import additional files using `@path/to/import` syntax. The following example imports 3 files:

```
See @README for project overview and @package.json for available npm commands for this project.

# Additional Instructions
- git workflow @docs/git-instructions.md
```

Both relative and absolute paths are allowed. In particular, importing files in user's home dir is a convenient way for your team members to provide individual instructions that are not checked into the repository. Previously CLAUDE.local.md served a similar purpose, but is now deprecated in favor of imports since they work better across multiple git worktrees.

```
# Individual Preferences
- @~/.claude/my-project-instructions.md
```

To avoid potential collisions, imports are not evaluated inside markdown code spans and code blocks.

```
This code span will not be treated as an import: `@anthropic-ai/claude-code`
```

Imported files can recursively import additional files, with a max-depth of 5 hops. You can see what memory files are loaded by running `/memory` command.

## How Claude looks up memories

Claude Code reads memories recursively: starting in the cwd, Claude Code recurses up to (but not including) the root directory */* and reads any CLAUDE.md or CLAUDE.local.md files it finds. This is especially convenient when working in large repositories where you run Claude Code in *foo/bar/*, and have memories in both *foo/CLAUDE.md* and *foo/bar/CLAUDE.md*.

Claude will also discover CLAUDE.md nested in subtrees under your current working directory. Instead of loading them at launch, they are only included when Claude reads files in those subtrees.

## Quickly add memories with the `#` shortcut

The fastest way to add a memory is to start your input with the `#` character:

```
# Always use descriptive variable names
```

You'll be prompted to select which memory file to store this in.

## Directly edit memories with `/memory`

Use the `/memory` slash command during a session to open any memory file in your system editor for more extensive additions or organization.

## Set up project memory

Suppose you want to set up a CLAUDE.md file to store important project information, conventions, and frequently used commands.

Bootstrap a CLAUDE.md for your codebase with the following command:

```
> /init 
```

<Tip>
  Tips:

  * Include frequently used commands (build, test, lint) to avoid repeated searches
  * Document code style preferences and naming conventions
  * Add important architectural patterns specific to your project
  * CLAUDE.md memories can be used for both instructions shared with your team and for your individual preferences.
</Tip>

## Memory best practices

* **Be specific**: "Use 2-space indentation" is better than "Format code properly".
* **Use structure to organize**: Format each individual memory as a bullet point and group related memories under descriptive markdown headings.
* **Review periodically**: Update memories as your project evolves to ensure Claude is always using the most up to date information and context.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Reference a single file">
    ```
    > Explain the logic in @src/utils/auth.js
    ```

    This includes the full content of the file in the conversation.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Reference a directory">
    ```
    > What's the structure of @src/components?
    ```

    This provides a directory listing with file information.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Reference MCP resources">
    ```
    > Show me the data from @github:repos/owner/repo/issues
    ```

    This fetches data from connected MCP servers using the format @server:resource. See [MCP resources](/en/docs/claude-code/mcp#use-mcp-resources) for details.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Tips:

  * File paths can be relative or absolute
  * @ file references add CLAUDE.md in the file's directory and parent directories to context
  * Directory references show file listings, not contents
  * You can reference multiple files in a single message (e.g., "@file1.js and @file2.js")
</Tip>

## Use extended thinking

Suppose you're working on complex architectural decisions, challenging bugs, or planning multi-step implementations that require deep reasoning.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Provide context and ask Claude to think">
    ```
    > I need to implement a new authentication system using OAuth2 for our API. Think deeply about the best approach for implementing this in our codebase. 
    ```

    Claude will gather relevant information from your codebase and
    use extended thinking, which will be visible in the interface.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Refine the thinking with follow-up prompts">
    ```
    > think about potential security vulnerabilities in this approach 
    ```

    ```
    > think harder about edge cases we should handle 
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Tips to get the most value out of extended thinking:

  Extended thinking is most valuable for complex tasks such as:

  * Planning complex architectural changes
  * Debugging intricate issues
  * Creating implementation plans for new features
  * Understanding complex codebases
  * Evaluating tradeoffs between different approaches

  The way you prompt for thinking results in varying levels of thinking depth:

  * "think" triggers basic extended thinking
  * intensifying phrases such as "think more", "think a lot", "think harder", or "think longer" triggers deeper thinking

  For more extended thinking prompting tips, see [Extended thinking tips](/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/extended-thinking-tips).
</Tip>

<Note>
  Claude will display its thinking process as italic gray text above the
  response.
</Note>

## Resume previous conversations

Suppose you've been working on a task with Claude Code and need to continue where you left off in a later session.

Claude Code provides two options for resuming previous conversations:

* `--continue` to automatically continue the most recent conversation
* `--resume` to display a conversation picker

<Steps>
  <Step title="Continue the most recent conversation">
    ```bash
    claude --continue
    ```

    This immediately resumes your most recent conversation without any prompts.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Continue in non-interactive mode">
    ```bash
    claude --continue --print "Continue with my task"
    ```

    Use `--print` with `--continue` to resume the most recent conversation in non-interactive mode, perfect for scripts or automation.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Show conversation picker">
    ```bash
    claude --resume
    ```

    This displays an interactive conversation selector showing:

    * Conversation start time
    * Initial prompt or conversation summary
    * Message count

    Use arrow keys to navigate and press Enter to select a conversation.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Tips:

  * Conversation history is stored locally on your machine
  * Use `--continue` for quick access to your most recent conversation
  * Use `--resume` when you need to select a specific past conversation
  * When resuming, you'll see the entire conversation history before continuing
  * The resumed conversation starts with the same model and configuration as the original

  How it works:

  1. **Conversation Storage**: All conversations are automatically saved locally with their full message history
  2. **Message Deserialization**: When resuming, the entire message history is restored to maintain context
  3. **Tool State**: Tool usage and results from the previous conversation are preserved
  4. **Context Restoration**: The conversation resumes with all previous context intact

  Examples:

  ```bash
  # Continue most recent conversation
  claude --continue

  # Continue most recent conversation with a specific prompt
  claude --continue --print "Show me our progress"

  # Show conversation picker
  claude --resume

  # Continue most recent conversation in non-interactive mode
  claude --continue --print "Run the tests again"
  ```
</Tip>

## Run parallel Claude Code sessions with Git worktrees

Suppose you need to work on multiple tasks simultaneously with complete code isolation between Claude Code instances.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Understand Git worktrees">
    Git worktrees allow you to check out multiple branches from the same
    repository into separate directories. Each worktree has its own working
    directory with isolated files, while sharing the same Git history. Learn
    more in the [official Git worktree
    documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a new worktree">
    ```bash
    # Create a new worktree with a new branch 
    git worktree add ../project-feature-a -b feature-a

    # Or create a worktree with an existing branch
    git worktree add ../project-bugfix bugfix-123
    ```

    This creates a new directory with a separate working copy of your repository.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run Claude Code in each worktree">
    ```bash
    # Navigate to your worktree 
    cd ../project-feature-a

    # Run Claude Code in this isolated environment
    claude
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run Claude in another worktree">
    ```bash
    cd ../project-bugfix
    claude
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Manage your worktrees">
    ```bash
    # List all worktrees
    git worktree list

    # Remove a worktree when done
    git worktree remove ../project-feature-a
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Tips:

  * Each worktree has its own independent file state, making it perfect for parallel Claude Code sessions
  * Changes made in one worktree won't affect others, preventing Claude instances from interfering with each other
  * All worktrees share the same Git history and remote connections
  * For long-running tasks, you can have Claude working in one worktree while you continue development in another
  * Use descriptive directory names to easily identify which task each worktree is for
  * Remember to initialize your development environment in each new worktree according to your project's setup. Depending on your stack, this might include:
    * JavaScript projects: Running dependency installation (`npm install`, `yarn`)
    * Python projects: Setting up virtual environments or installing with package managers
    * Other languages: Following your project's standard setup process
</Tip>

## Use Claude as a unix-style utility

### Add Claude to your verification process

Suppose you want to use Claude Code as a linter or code reviewer.

**Add Claude to your build script:**

```json
// package.json
{
    ...
    "scripts": {
        ...
        "lint:claude": "claude -p 'you are a linter. please look at the changes vs. main and report any issues related to typos. report the filename and line number on one line, and a description of the issue on the second line. do not return any other text.'"
    }
}
```

<Tip>
  Tips:

  * Use Claude for automated code review in your CI/CD pipeline
  * Customize the prompt to check for specific issues relevant to your project
  * Consider creating multiple scripts for different types of verification
</Tip>

### Pipe in, pipe out

Suppose you want to pipe data into Claude, and get back data in a structured format.

**Pipe data through Claude:**

```bash
cat build-error.txt | claude -p 'concisely explain the root cause of this build error' > output.txt
```

<Tip>
  Tips:

  * Use pipes to integrate Claude into existing shell scripts
  * Combine with other Unix tools for powerful workflows
  * Consider using --output-format for structured output
</Tip>

### Control output format

Suppose you need Claude's output in a specific format, especially when integrating Claude Code into scripts or other tools.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Use text format (default)">
    ```bash
    cat data.txt | claude -p 'summarize this data' --output-format text > summary.txt
    ```

    This outputs just Claude's plain text response (default behavior).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use JSON format">
    ```bash
    cat code.py | claude -p 'analyze this code for bugs' --output-format json > analysis.json
    ```

    This outputs a JSON array of messages with metadata including cost and duration.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use streaming JSON format">
    ```bash
    cat log.txt | claude -p 'parse this log file for errors' --output-format stream-json
    ```

    This outputs a series of JSON objects in real-time as Claude processes the request. Each message is a valid JSON object, but the entire output is not valid JSON if concatenated.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Tips:

  * Use `--output-format text` for simple integrations where you just need Claude's response
  * Use `--output-format json` when you need the full conversation log
  * Use `--output-format stream-json` for real-time output of each conversation turn
</Tip>

## Create custom slash commands

Claude Code supports custom slash commands that you can create to quickly execute specific prompts or tasks.

For more details, see the [Slash commands](/en/docs/claude-code/slash-commands) reference page.

### Create project-specific commands

Suppose you want to create reusable slash commands for your project that all team members can use.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a commands directory in your project">
    ```bash
    mkdir -p .claude/commands
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a Markdown file for each command">
    ```bash
    echo "Analyze the performance of this code and suggest three specific optimizations:" > .claude/commands/optimize.md 
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use your custom command in Claude Code">
    ```
    > /project:optimize 
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Tips:

  * Command names are derived from the filename (e.g., `optimize.md` becomes `/project:optimize`)
  * You can organize commands in subdirectories (e.g., `.claude/commands/frontend/component.md` becomes `/project:frontend:component`)
  * Project commands are available to everyone who clones the repository
  * The Markdown file content becomes the prompt sent to Claude when the command is invoked
</Tip>

### Add command arguments with \$ARGUMENTS

Suppose you want to create flexible slash commands that can accept additional input from users.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a command file with the $ARGUMENTS placeholder">
    ```bash
    echo "Find and fix issue #$ARGUMENTS. Follow these steps: 1.
    Understand the issue described in the ticket 2. Locate the relevant code in
    our codebase 3. Implement a solution that addresses the root cause 4. Add
    appropriate tests 5. Prepare a concise PR description" >
    .claude/commands/fix-issue.md 
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use the command with an issue number">
    In your Claude session, use the command with arguments.

    ```
    > /project:fix-issue 123 
    ```

    This will replace \$ARGUMENTS with "123" in the prompt.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Tips:

  * The \$ARGUMENTS placeholder is replaced with any text that follows the command
  * You can position \$ARGUMENTS anywhere in your command template
  * Other useful applications: generating test cases for specific functions, creating documentation for components, reviewing code in particular files, or translating content to specified languages
</Tip>

### Create personal slash commands

Suppose you want to create personal slash commands that work across all your projects.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a commands directory in your home folder">
    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/.claude/commands 
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a Markdown file for each command">
    ```bash
    echo "Review this code for security vulnerabilities, focusing on:" >
    ~/.claude/commands/security-review.md 
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use your personal custom command">
    ```
    > /user:security-review 
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Tips:

  * Personal commands are prefixed with `/user:` instead of `/project:`
  * Personal commands are only available to you and not shared with your team
  * Personal commands work across all your projects
  * You can use these for consistent workflows across different codebases
</Tip>

# Model Context Protocol (MCP)

> Learn how to set up MCP with Claude Code.

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that enables LLMs to access external tools and data sources. For more details about MCP, see the [MCP documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction).

<Warning>
  Use third party MCP servers at your own risk. Make sure you trust the MCP
  servers, and be especially careful when using MCP servers that talk to the
  internet, as these can expose you to prompt injection risk.
</Warning>

## Configure MCP servers

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add an MCP stdio Server">
    ```bash
    # Basic syntax
    claude mcp add <name> <command> [args...]

    # Example: Adding a local server
    claude mcp add my-server -e API_KEY=123 -- /path/to/server arg1 arg2
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add an MCP SSE Server">
    ```bash
    # Basic syntax
    claude mcp add --transport sse <name> <url>

    # Example: Adding an SSE server
    claude mcp add --transport sse sse-server https://example.com/sse-endpoint

    # Example: Adding an SSE server with custom headers
    claude mcp add --transport sse api-server https://api.example.com/mcp --header "X-API-Key: your-key"
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add an MCP HTTP Server">
    ```bash
    # Basic syntax
    claude mcp add --transport http <name> <url>

    # Example: Adding a streamable HTTP server
    claude mcp add --transport http http-server https://example.com/mcp

    # Example: Adding an HTTP server with authentication header
    claude mcp add --transport http secure-server https://api.example.com/mcp --header "Authorization: Bearer your-token"
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Manage your MCP servers">
    ```bash
    # List all configured servers
    claude mcp list

    # Get details for a specific server
    claude mcp get my-server

    # Remove a server
    claude mcp remove my-server
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Tips:

  * Use the `-s` or `--scope` flag to specify where the configuration is stored:
    * `local` (default): Available only to you in the current project (was called `project` in older versions)
    * `project`: Shared with everyone in the project via `.mcp.json` file
    * `user`: Available to you across all projects (was called `global` in older versions)
  * Set environment variables with `-e` or `--env` flags (e.g., `-e KEY=value`)
  * Configure MCP server startup timeout using the MCP\_TIMEOUT environment variable (e.g., `MCP_TIMEOUT=10000 claude` sets a 10-second timeout)
  * Check MCP server status any time using the `/mcp` command within Claude Code
  * MCP follows a client-server architecture where Claude Code (the client) can connect to multiple specialized servers
  * Claude Code supports SSE (Server-Sent Events) and streamable HTTP servers for real-time communication
  * Use `/mcp` to authenticate with remote servers that require OAuth 2.0 authentication
</Tip>

## Understanding MCP server scopes

MCP servers can be configured at three different scope levels, each serving distinct purposes for managing server accessibility and sharing. Understanding these scopes helps you determine the best way to configure servers for your specific needs.

### Scope hierarchy and precedence

MCP server configurations follow a clear precedence hierarchy. When servers with the same name exist at multiple scopes, the system resolves conflicts by prioritizing local-scoped servers first, followed by project-scoped servers, and finally user-scoped servers. This design ensures that personal configurations can override shared ones when needed.

### Local scope

Local-scoped servers represent the default configuration level and are stored in your project-specific user settings. These servers remain private to you and are only accessible when working within the current project directory. This scope is ideal for personal development servers, experimental configurations, or servers containing sensitive credentials that shouldn't be shared.

```bash
# Add a local-scoped server (default)
claude mcp add my-private-server /path/to/server

# Explicitly specify local scope
claude mcp add my-private-server -s local /path/to/server
```

### Project scope

Project-scoped servers enable team collaboration by storing configurations in a `.mcp.json` file at your project's root directory. This file is designed to be checked into version control, ensuring all team members have access to the same MCP tools and services. When you add a project-scoped server, Claude Code automatically creates or updates this file with the appropriate configuration structure.

```bash
# Add a project-scoped server
claude mcp add shared-server -s project /path/to/server
```

The resulting `.mcp.json` file follows a standardized format:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "shared-server": {
      "command": "/path/to/server",
      "args": [],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

For security reasons, Claude Code prompts for approval before using project-scoped servers from `.mcp.json` files. If you need to reset these approval choices, use the `claude mcp reset-project-choices` command.

### User scope

User-scoped servers provide cross-project accessibility, making them available across all projects on your machine while remaining private to your user account. This scope works well for personal utility servers, development tools, or services you frequently use across different projects.

```bash
# Add a user server
claude mcp add my-user-server -s user /path/to/server
```

### Choosing the right scope

Select your scope based on:

* **Local scope**: Personal servers, experimental configurations, or sensitive credentials specific to one project
* **Project scope**: Team-shared servers, project-specific tools, or services required for collaboration
* **User scope**: Personal utilities needed across multiple projects, development tools, or frequently-used services

## Authenticate with remote MCP servers

Many remote MCP servers require authentication. Claude Code supports OAuth 2.0 authentication flow for secure connection to these servers.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add a remote server requiring authentication">
    ```bash
    # Add an SSE or HTTP server that requires OAuth
    claude mcp add --transport sse github-server https://api.github.com/mcp
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Authenticate using the /mcp command">
    Within Claude Code, use the `/mcp` command to manage authentication:

    ```
    > /mcp
    ```

    This opens an interactive menu where you can:

    * View connection status for all servers
    * Authenticate with servers requiring OAuth
    * Clear existing authentication
    * View server capabilities
  </Step>

  <Step title="Complete the OAuth flow">
    When you select "Authenticate" for a server:

    1. Your browser opens automatically to the OAuth provider
    2. Complete the authentication in your browser
    3. Claude Code receives and securely stores the access token
    4. The server connection becomes active
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Tips:

  * Authentication tokens are stored securely and refreshed automatically
  * Use "Clear authentication" in the `/mcp` menu to revoke access
  * If your browser doesn't open automatically, copy the provided URL
  * OAuth authentication works with both SSE and HTTP transports
</Tip>

## Connect to a Postgres MCP server

Suppose you want to give Claude read-only access to a PostgreSQL database for querying and schema inspection.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add the Postgres MCP server">
    ```bash
    claude mcp add postgres-server /path/to/postgres-mcp-server --connection-string "postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/mydb"
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Query your database with Claude">
    ```
    > describe the schema of our users table
    ```

    ```
    > what are the most recent orders in the system?
    ```

    ```
    > show me the relationship between customers and invoices
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Tips:

  * The Postgres MCP server provides read-only access for safety
  * Claude can help you explore database structure and run analytical queries
  * You can use this to quickly understand database schemas in unfamiliar projects
  * Make sure your connection string uses appropriate credentials with minimum required permissions
</Tip>

## Add MCP servers from JSON configuration

Suppose you have a JSON configuration for a single MCP server that you want to add to Claude Code.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add an MCP server from JSON">
    ```bash
    # Basic syntax
    claude mcp add-json <name> '<json>'

    # Example: Adding a stdio server with JSON configuration
    claude mcp add-json weather-api '{"type":"stdio","command":"/path/to/weather-cli","args":["--api-key","abc123"],"env":{"CACHE_DIR":"/tmp"}}'
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify the server was added">
    ```bash
    claude mcp get weather-api
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Tips:

  * Make sure the JSON is properly escaped in your shell
  * The JSON must conform to the MCP server configuration schema
  * You can use `-s global` to add the server to your global configuration instead of the project-specific one
</Tip>

## Import MCP servers from Claude Desktop

Suppose you have already configured MCP servers in Claude Desktop and want to use the same servers in Claude Code without manually reconfiguring them.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Import servers from Claude Desktop">
    ```bash
    # Basic syntax 
    claude mcp add-from-claude-desktop 
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select which servers to import">
    After running the command, you'll see an interactive dialog that allows you to select which servers you want to import.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify the servers were imported">
    ```bash
    claude mcp list 
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Tips:

  * This feature only works on macOS and Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
  * It reads the Claude Desktop configuration file from its standard location on those platforms
  * Use the `-s global` flag to add servers to your global configuration
  * Imported servers will have the same names as in Claude Desktop
  * If servers with the same names already exist, they will get a numerical suffix (e.g., `server_1`)
</Tip>

## Use Claude Code as an MCP server

Suppose you want to use Claude Code itself as an MCP server that other applications can connect to, providing them with Claude's tools and capabilities.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start Claude as an MCP server">
    ```bash
    # Basic syntax
    claude mcp serve
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect from another application">
    You can connect to Claude Code MCP server from any MCP client, such as Claude Desktop. If you're using Claude Desktop, you can add the Claude Code MCP server using this configuration:

    ```json
    {
      "command": "claude",
      "args": ["mcp", "serve"],
      "env": {}
    }
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Tips:

  * The server provides access to Claude's tools like View, Edit, LS, etc.
  * In Claude Desktop, try asking Claude to read files in a directory, make edits, and more.
  * Note that this MCP server is simply exposing Claude Code's tools to your MCP client, so your own client is responsible for implementing user confirmation for individual tool calls.
</Tip>

## Use MCP resources

MCP servers can expose resources that you can reference using @ mentions, similar to how you reference files.

### Reference MCP resources

<Steps>
  <Step title="List available resources">
    Type `@` in your prompt to see available resources from all connected MCP servers. Resources appear alongside files in the autocomplete menu.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Reference a specific resource">
    Use the format `@server:protocol://resource/path` to reference a resource:

    ```
    > Can you analyze @github:issue://123 and suggest a fix?
    ```

    ```
    > Please review the API documentation at @docs:file://api/authentication
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Multiple resource references">
    You can reference multiple resources in a single prompt:

    ```
    > Compare @postgres:schema://users with @docs:file://database/user-model
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Tips:

  * Resources are automatically fetched and included as attachments when referenced
  * Resource paths are fuzzy-searchable in the @ mention autocomplete
  * Claude Code automatically provides tools to list and read MCP resources when servers support them
  * Resources can contain any type of content that the MCP server provides (text, JSON, structured data, etc.)
</Tip>

## Use MCP prompts as slash commands

MCP servers can expose prompts that become available as slash commands in Claude Code.

### Execute MCP prompts

<Steps>
  <Step title="Discover available prompts">
    Type `/` to see all available commands, including those from MCP servers. MCP prompts appear with the format `/mcp__servername__promptname`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Execute a prompt without arguments">
    ```
    > /mcp__github__list_prs
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Execute a prompt with arguments">
    Many prompts accept arguments. Pass them space-separated after the command:

    ```
    > /mcp__github__pr_review 456
    ```

    ```
    > /mcp__jira__create_issue "Bug in login flow" high
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Tips:

  * MCP prompts are dynamically discovered from connected servers
  * Arguments are parsed based on the prompt's defined parameters
  * Prompt results are injected directly into the conversation
  * Server and prompt names are normalized (spaces become underscores)
</Tip>

## Best practices

### CLAUDE.md configuration

Create a `CLAUDE.md` file in your repository root to define code style guidelines, review criteria, project-specific rules, and preferred patterns. This file guides Claude's understanding of your project standards.

### Security considerations

<Warning>
  Never commit API keys directly to your repository!
</Warning>

Always use GitHub Secrets for API keys:

* Add your API key as a repository secret named `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
* Reference it in workflows: `anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}`
* Limit action permissions to only what's necessary
* Review Claude's suggestions before merging

Always use GitHub Secrets (e.g., `${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}`) rather than hardcoding API keys directly in your workflow files.

### Optimizing performance

Use issue templates to provide context, keep your `CLAUDE.md` concise and focused, and configure appropriate timeouts for your workflows.

### CI costs

When using Claude Code GitHub Actions, be aware of the associated costs:

**GitHub Actions costs:**

* Claude Code runs on GitHub-hosted runners, which consume your GitHub Actions minutes
* See [GitHub's billing documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-your-products/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions) for detailed pricing and minute limits

**API costs:**

* Each Claude interaction consumes API tokens based on the length of prompts and responses
* Token usage varies by task complexity and codebase size
* See [Claude's pricing page](https://www.anthropic.com/api) for current token rates

**Cost optimization tips:**

* Use specific `@claude` commands to reduce unnecessary API calls
* Configure appropriate `max_turns` limits to prevent excessive iterations
* Set reasonable `timeout_minutes` to avoid runaway workflows
* Consider using GitHub's concurrency controls to limit parallel runs

## Configuration examples

For ready-to-use workflow configurations for different use cases, including:

* Basic workflow setup for issue and PR comments
* Automated code reviews on pull requests
* Custom implementations for specific needs

<Tip>
  The examples repository includes complete, tested workflows that you can copy directly into your `.github/workflows/` directory.
</Tip>

## Using with AWS Bedrock & Google Vertex AI

For enterprise environments, you can use Claude Code GitHub Actions with your own cloud infrastructure. This approach gives you control over data residency and billing while maintaining the same functionality.

### Prerequisites

Before setting up Claude Code GitHub Actions with cloud providers, you need:

#### For Google Cloud Vertex AI:

1. A Google Cloud Project with Vertex AI enabled
2. Workload Identity Federation configured for GitHub Actions
3. A service account with the required permissions
4. A GitHub App (recommended) or use the default GITHUB\_TOKEN

#### For AWS Bedrock:

1. An AWS account with Amazon Bedrock enabled
2. GitHub OIDC Identity Provider configured in AWS
3. An IAM role with Bedrock permissions
4. A GitHub App (recommended) or use the default GITHUB\_TOKEN

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a custom GitHub App (Recommended for 3P Providers)">
    For best control and security when using 3P providers like Vertex AI or Bedrock, we recommend creating your own GitHub App:

    1. Go to [https://github.com/settings/apps/new](https://github.com/settings/apps/new)
    2. Fill in the basic information:
       * **GitHub App name**: Choose a unique name (e.g., "YourOrg Claude Assistant")
       * **Homepage URL**: Your organization's website or the repository URL
    3. Configure the app settings:
       * **Webhooks**: Uncheck "Active" (not needed for this integration)
    4. Set the required permissions:
       * **Repository permissions**:
         * Contents: Read & Write
         * Issues: Read & Write
         * Pull requests: Read & Write
    5. Click "Create GitHub App"
    6. After creation, click "Generate a private key" and save the downloaded `.pem` file
    7. Note your App ID from the app settings page
    8. Install the app to your repository:
       * From your app's settings page, click "Install App" in the left sidebar
       * Select your account or organization
       * Choose "Only select repositories" and select the specific repository
       * Click "Install"
    9. Add the private key as a secret to your repository:
       * Go to your repository's Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
       * Create a new secret named `APP_PRIVATE_KEY` with the contents of the `.pem` file
    10. Add the App ID as a secret:

    * Create a new secret named `APP_ID` with your GitHub App's ID

    <Note>
      This app will be used with the [actions/create-github-app-token](https://github.com/actions/create-github-app-token) action to generate authentication tokens in your workflows.
    </Note>

    **Alternative for Anthropic API or if you don't want to setup your own Github app**: Use the official Anthropic app:

    1. Install from: [https://github.com/apps/claude](https://github.com/apps/claude)
    2. No additional configuration needed for authentication
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure cloud provider authentication">
    Choose your cloud provider and set up secure authentication:

    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="AWS Bedrock">
        **Configure AWS to allow GitHub Actions to authenticate securely without storing credentials.**

        > **Security Note**: Use repository-specific configurations and grant only the minimum required permissions.

        **Required Setup**:

        1. **Enable Amazon Bedrock**:
           * Request access to Claude models in Amazon Bedrock
           * For cross-region models, request access in all required regions

        2. **Set up GitHub OIDC Identity Provider**:
           * Provider URL: `https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`

        3. **Create IAM Role for GitHub Actions**:
           * Trusted entity type: Web identity
           * Identity provider: `token.actions.githubusercontent.com`
           * Permissions: `AmazonBedrockFullAccess` policy
           * Configure trust policy for your specific repository

        **Required Values**:

        After setup, you'll need:

        * **AWS\_ROLE\_TO\_ASSUME**: The ARN of the IAM role you created

        <Tip>
          OIDC is more secure than using static AWS access keys because credentials are temporary and automatically rotated.
        </Tip>

        See [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_create_oidc.html) for detailed OIDC setup instructions.

      <Accordion title="Google Vertex AI">
        **Configure Google Cloud to allow GitHub Actions to authenticate securely without storing credentials.**

        > **Security Note**: Use repository-specific configurations and grant only the minimum required permissions.

        **Required Setup**:

        1. **Enable APIs** in your Google Cloud project:
           * IAM Credentials API
           * Security Token Service (STS) API
           * Vertex AI API

        2. **Create Workload Identity Federation resources**:
           * Create a Workload Identity Pool
           * Add a GitHub OIDC provider with:
             * Issuer: `https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`
             * Attribute mappings for repository and owner
             * **Security recommendation**: Use repository-specific attribute conditions

        3. **Create a Service Account**:
           * Grant only `Vertex AI User` role
           * **Security recommendation**: Create a dedicated service account per repository

        4. **Configure IAM bindings**:
           * Allow the Workload Identity Pool to impersonate the service account
           * **Security recommendation**: Use repository-specific principal sets

        **Required Values**:

        After setup, you'll need:

        * **GCP\_WORKLOAD\_IDENTITY\_PROVIDER**: The full provider resource name
        * **GCP\_SERVICE\_ACCOUNT**: The service account email address

        <Tip>
          Workload Identity Federation eliminates the need for downloadable service account keys, improving security.
        </Tip>

        For detailed setup instructions, consult the [Google Cloud Workload Identity Federation documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workload-identity-federation).

## Troubleshooting

### Claude not responding to @claude commands

Verify the GitHub App is installed correctly, check that workflows are enabled, ensure API key is set in repository secrets, and confirm the comment contains `@claude` (not `/claude`).

### CI not running on Claude's commits

Ensure you're using the GitHub App or custom app (not Actions user), check workflow triggers include the necessary events, and verify app permissions include CI triggers.

### Authentication errors

Confirm API key is valid and has sufficient permissions. For Bedrock/Vertex, check credentials configuration and ensure secrets are named correctly in workflows.

## Advanced configuration

### Action parameters

The Claude Code Action supports these key parameters:

| Parameter           | Description                    | Required |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------- |
| `prompt`            | The prompt to send to Claude   | Yes\*    |
| `prompt_file`       | Path to file containing prompt | Yes\*    |
| `anthropic_api_key` | Anthropic API key              | Yes\*\*  |
| `max_turns`         | Maximum conversation turns     | No       |
| `timeout_minutes`   | Execution timeout              | No       |

\*Either `prompt` or `prompt_file` required\
\*\*Required for direct Anthropic API, not for Bedrock/Vertex

### Alternative integration methods

While the `/install-github-app` command is the recommended approach, you can also:

* **Custom GitHub App**: For organizations needing branded usernames or custom authentication flows. Create your own GitHub App with required permissions (contents, issues, pull requests) and use the actions/create-github-app-token action to generate tokens in your workflows.
* **Manual GitHub Actions**: Direct workflow configuration for maximum flexibility
* **MCP Configuration**: Dynamic loading of Model Context Protocol servers

See the [Claude Code Action repository](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action) for detailed documentation.

### Customizing Claude's behavior

You can configure Claude's behavior in two ways:

1. **CLAUDE.md**: Define coding standards, review criteria, and project-specific rules in a `CLAUDE.md` file at the root of your repository. Claude will follow these guidelines when creating PRs and responding to requests. Check out our [Memory documentation](/en/docs/claude-code/memory) for more details.
2. **Custom prompts**: Use the `prompt` parameter in the workflow file to provide workflow-specific instructions. This allows you to customize Claude's behavior for different workflows or tasks.

Claude will follow these guidelines when creating PRs and responding to requests.

# Claude Code SDK

> Learn about programmatically integrating Claude Code into your applications with the Claude Code SDK.

The Claude Code SDK enables running Claude Code as a subprocess, providing a way to build AI-powered coding assistants and tools that leverage Claude's capabilities.

The SDK is available for command line, TypeScript, and Python usage.

## Authentication

The Claude Code SDK supports multiple authentication methods:

### Anthropic API key

To use the Claude Code SDK directly with Anthropic's API, we recommend creating a dedicated API key:

1. Create an Anthropic API key in the [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/)
2. Then, set the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable. We recommend storing this key securely (e.g., using a Github [secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions))

### Third-Party API credentials

The SDK also supports third-party API providers:

* **Amazon Bedrock**: Set `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK=1` environment variable and configure AWS credentials
* **Google Vertex AI**: Set `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX=1` environment variable and configure Google Cloud credentials

For detailed configuration instructions for third-party providers, see the [Amazon Bedrock](/en/docs/claude-code/amazon-bedrock) and [Google Vertex AI](/en/docs/claude-code/google-vertex-ai) documentation.

## Basic SDK usage

The Claude Code SDK allows you to use Claude Code in non-interactive mode from your applications.

### Command line

Here are a few basic examples for the command line SDK:

```bash
# Run a single prompt and exit (print mode)
$ claude -p "Write a function to calculate Fibonacci numbers"

# Using a pipe to provide stdin
$ echo "Explain this code" | claude -p

# Output in JSON format with metadata
$ claude -p "Generate a hello world function" --output-format json

# Stream JSON output as it arrives
$ claude -p "Build a React component" --output-format stream-json
```

### TypeScript

The TypeScript SDK is included in the main [`@anthropic-ai/claude-code`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@anthropic-ai/claude-code) package on NPM:

```ts
import { query, type SDKMessage } from "@anthropic-ai/claude-code";

const messages: SDKMessage[] = [];

for await (const message of query({
  prompt: "Write a haiku about foo.py",
  abortController: new AbortController(),
  options: {
    maxTurns: 3,
  },
})) {
  messages.push(message);
}

console.log(messages);
```

The TypeScript SDK accepts all arguments supported by the command line SDK, as well as:

| Argument                     | Description                         | Default                                                       |
| :--------------------------- | :---------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `abortController`            | Abort controller                    | `new AbortController()`                                       |
| `cwd`                        | Current working directory           | `process.cwd()`                                               |
| `executable`                 | Which JavaScript runtime to use     | `node` when running with Node.js, `bun` when running with Bun |
| `executableArgs`             | Arguments to pass to the executable | `[]`                                                          |
| `pathToClaudeCodeExecutable` | Path to the Claude Code executable  | Executable that ships with `@anthropic-ai/claude-code`        |

### Python

The Python SDK is available as [`claude-code-sdk`](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-sdk-python) on PyPI:

```bash
pip install claude-code-sdk
```

**Prerequisites:**

* Python 3.10+
* Node.js
* Claude Code CLI: `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`

Basic usage:

```python
import anyio
from claude_code_sdk import query, ClaudeCodeOptions, Message

async def main():
    messages: list[Message] = []
    
    async for message in query(
        prompt="Write a haiku about foo.py",
        options=ClaudeCodeOptions(max_turns=3)
    ):
        messages.append(message)
    
    print(messages)

anyio.run(main)
```

The Python SDK accepts all arguments supported by the command line SDK through the `ClaudeCodeOptions` class:

```python
from claude_code_sdk import query, ClaudeCodeOptions
from pathlib import Path

options = ClaudeCodeOptions(
    max_turns=3,
    system_prompt="You are a helpful assistant",
    cwd=Path("/path/to/project"),  # Can be string or Path
    allowed_tools=["Read", "Write", "Bash"],
    permission_mode="acceptEdits"
)

async for message in query(prompt="Hello", options=options):
    print(message)
```

## Advanced usage

The documentation below uses the command line SDK as an example, but can also be used with the TypeScript and Python SDKs.

### Multi-turn conversations

For multi-turn conversations, you can resume conversations or continue from the most recent session:

```bash
# Continue the most recent conversation
$ claude --continue

# Continue and provide a new prompt
$ claude --continue "Now refactor this for better performance"

# Resume a specific conversation by session ID
$ claude --resume 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000

# Resume in print mode (non-interactive)
$ claude -p --resume 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000 "Update the tests"

# Continue in print mode (non-interactive)
$ claude -p --continue "Add error handling"
```

### Custom system prompts

You can provide custom system prompts to guide Claude's behavior:

```bash
# Override system prompt (only works with --print)
$ claude -p "Build a REST API" --system-prompt "You are a senior backend engineer. Focus on security, performance, and maintainability."

# System prompt with specific requirements
$ claude -p "Create a database schema" --system-prompt "You are a database architect. Use PostgreSQL best practices and include proper indexing."
```

You can also append instructions to the default system prompt:

```bash
# Append system prompt (only works with --print)
$ claude -p "Build a REST API" --append-system-prompt "After writing code, be sure to code review yourself."
```

### MCP Configuration

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) allows you to extend Claude Code with additional tools and resources from external servers. Using the `--mcp-config` flag, you can load MCP servers that provide specialized capabilities like database access, API integrations, or custom tooling.

Create a JSON configuration file with your MCP servers:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem",
        "/path/to/allowed/files"
      ]
    },
    "github": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_TOKEN": "your-github-token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Then use it with Claude Code:

```bash
# Load MCP servers from configuration
$ claude -p "List all files in the project" --mcp-config mcp-servers.json

# Important: MCP tools must be explicitly allowed using --allowedTools
# MCP tools follow the format: mcp__$serverName__$toolName
$ claude -p "Search for TODO comments" \
  --mcp-config mcp-servers.json \
  --allowedTools "mcp__filesystem__read_file,mcp__filesystem__list_directory"

# Use an MCP tool for handling permission prompts in non-interactive mode
$ claude -p "Deploy the application" \
  --mcp-config mcp-servers.json \
  --allowedTools "mcp__permissions__approve" \
  --permission-prompt-tool mcp__permissions__approve
```

<Note>
  When using MCP tools, you must explicitly allow them using the `--allowedTools` flag. MCP tool names follow the pattern `mcp__<serverName>__<toolName>` where:

  * `serverName` is the key from your MCP configuration file
  * `toolName` is the specific tool provided by that server

  This security measure ensures that MCP tools are only used when explicitly permitted.

  If you specify just the server name (i.e., `mcp__<serverName>`), all tools from that server will be allowed.

  Glob patterns (e.g., `mcp__go*`) are not supported.
</Note>

### Custom permission prompt tool

Optionally, use `--permission-prompt-tool` to pass in an MCP tool that we will use to check whether or not the user grants the model permissions to invoke a given tool. When the model invokes a tool the following happens:

1. We first check permission settings: all [settings.json files](/en/docs/claude-code/settings), as well as `--allowedTools` and `--disallowedTools` passed into the SDK; if one of these allows or denies the tool call, we proceed with the tool call
2. Otherwise, we invoke the MCP tool you provided in `--permission-prompt-tool`

The `--permission-prompt-tool` MCP tool is passed the tool name and input, and must return a JSON-stringified payload with the result. The payload must be one of:

```ts
// tool call is allowed
{
  "behavior": "allow",
  "updatedInput": {...}, // updated input, or just return back the original input
}

// tool call is denied
{
  "behavior": "deny",
  "message": "..." // human-readable string explaining why the permission was denied
}
```

For example, a TypeScript MCP permission prompt tool implementation might look like this:

```ts
const server = new McpServer({
  name: "Test permission prompt MCP Server",
  version: "0.0.1",
});

server.tool(
  "approval_prompt",
  'Simulate a permission check - approve if the input contains "allow", otherwise deny',
  {
    tool_name: z.string().describe("The tool requesting permission"),
    input: z.object({}).passthrough().describe("The input for the tool"),
  },
  async ({ tool_name, input }) => {
    return {
      content: [
        {
          type: "text",
          text: JSON.stringify(
            JSON.stringify(input).includes("allow")
              ? {
                  behavior: "allow",
                  updatedInput: input,
                }
              : {
                  behavior: "deny",
                  message: "Permission denied by test approval_prompt tool",
                }
          ),
        },
      ],
    };
  }
);
```

To use this tool, add your MCP server (eg. with `--mcp-config`), then invoke the SDK like so:

```sh
claude -p "..." \
  --permission-prompt-tool mcp__test-server__approval_prompt \
  --mcp-config my-config.json
```

Usage notes:

* Use `updatedInput` to tell the model that the permission prompt mutated its input; otherwise, set `updatedInput` to the original input, as in the example above. For example, if the tool shows a file edit diff to the user and lets them edit the diff manually, the permission prompt tool should return that updated edit.
* The payload must be JSON-stringified

For a complete list of CLI options and features, see the [CLI reference](/en/docs/claude-code/cli-reference) documentation.

## Output formats

The SDK supports multiple output formats:

### Text output (default)

Returns just the response text:

```bash
$ claude -p "Explain file src/components/Header.tsx"
# Output: This is a React component showing...
```

### JSON output

Returns structured data including metadata:

```bash
$ claude -p "How does the data layer work?" --output-format json
```

Response format:

```json
{
  "type": "result",
  "subtype": "success",
  "total_cost_usd": 0.003,
  "is_error": false,
  "duration_ms": 1234,
  "duration_api_ms": 800,
  "num_turns": 6,
  "result": "The response text here...",
  "session_id": "abc123"
}
```

### Streaming JSON output

Streams each message as it is received:

```bash
$ claude -p "Build an application" --output-format stream-json
```

Each conversation begins with an initial `init` system message, followed by a list of user and assistant messages, followed by a final `result` system message with stats. Each message is emitted as a separate JSON object.

## Message schema

Messages returned from the JSON API are strictly typed according to the following schema:

```ts
type SDKMessage =
  // An assistant message
  | {
      type: "assistant";
      message: Message; // from Anthropic SDK
      session_id: string;
    }

  // A user message
  | {
      type: "user";
      message: MessageParam; // from Anthropic SDK
      session_id: string;
    }

  // Emitted as the last message
  | {
      type: "result";
      subtype: "success";
      duration_ms: float;
      duration_api_ms: float;
      is_error: boolean;
      num_turns: int;
      result: string;
      session_id: string;
      total_cost_usd: float;
    }

  // Emitted as the last message, when we've reached the maximum number of turns
  | {
      type: "result";
      subtype: "error_max_turns" | "error_during_execution";
      duration_ms: float;
      duration_api_ms: float;
      is_error: boolean;
      num_turns: int;
      session_id: string;
      total_cost_usd: float;
    }

  // Emitted as the first message at the start of a conversation
  | {
      type: "system";
      subtype: "init";
      apiKeySource: string;
      cwd: string;
      session_id: string;
      tools: string[];
      mcp_servers: {
        name: string;
        status: string;
      }[];
      model: string;
      permissionMode: "default" | "acceptEdits" | "bypassPermissions" | "plan";
    };
```

We will soon publish these types in a JSONSchema-compatible format. We use semantic versioning for the main Claude Code package to communicate breaking changes to this format.

`Message` and `MessageParam` types are available in Anthropic SDKs. For example, see the Anthropic [TypeScript](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-typescript) and [Python](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-python/) SDKs.

## Input formats

The SDK supports multiple input formats:

### Text input (default)

Input text can be provided as an argument:

```bash
$ claude -p "Explain this code"
```

Or input text can be piped via stdin:

```bash
$ echo "Explain this code" | claude -p
```

### Streaming JSON input

A stream of messages provided via `stdin` where each message represents a user turn. This allows multiple turns of a conversation without re-launching the `claude` binary and allows providing guidance to the model while it is processing a request.

Each message is a JSON 'User message' object, following the same format as the output message schema. Messages are formatted using the [jsonl](https://jsonlines.org/) format where each line of input is a complete JSON object. Streaming JSON input requires `-p` and `--output-format stream-json`.

Currently this is limited to text-only user messages.

```bash
$ echo '{"type":"user","message":{"role":"user","content":[{"type":"text","text":"Explain this code"}]}}' | claude -p --output-format=stream-json --input-format=stream-json --verbose
```

## Examples

### Simple script integration

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Simple function to run Claude and check exit code
run_claude() {
    local prompt="$1"
    local output_format="${2:-text}"

    if claude -p "$prompt" --output-format "$output_format"; then
        echo "Success!"
    else
        echo "Error: Claude failed with exit code $?" >&2
        return 1
    fi
}

# Usage examples
run_claude "Write a Python function to read CSV files"
run_claude "Optimize this database query" "json"
```

### Processing files with Claude

```bash
# Process a file through Claude
$ cat mycode.py | claude -p "Review this code for bugs"

# Process multiple files
$ for file in *.js; do
    echo "Processing $file..."
    claude -p "Add JSDoc comments to this file:" < "$file" > "${file}.documented"
done

# Use Claude in a pipeline
$ grep -l "TODO" *.py | while read file; do
    claude -p "Fix all TODO items in this file" < "$file"
done
```

### Session management

```bash
# Start a session and capture the session ID
$ claude -p "Initialize a new project" --output-format json | jq -r '.session_id' > session.txt

# Continue with the same session
$ claude -p --resume "$(cat session.txt)" "Add unit tests"
```

## Best practices

1. **Use JSON output format** for programmatic parsing of responses:

   ```bash
   # Parse JSON response with jq
   result=$(claude -p "Generate code" --output-format json)
   code=$(echo "$result" | jq -r '.result')
   cost=$(echo "$result" | jq -r '.cost_usd')
   ```

2. **Handle errors gracefully** - check exit codes and stderr:

   ```bash
   if ! claude -p "$prompt" 2>error.log; then
       echo "Error occurred:" >&2
       cat error.log >&2
       exit 1
   fi
   ```

3. **Use session management** for maintaining context in multi-turn conversations

4. **Consider timeouts** for long-running operations:

   ```bash
   timeout 300 claude -p "$complex_prompt" || echo "Timed out after 5 minutes"
   ```

5. **Respect rate limits** when making multiple requests by adding delays between calls

## Real-world applications

The Claude Code SDK enables powerful integrations with your development workflow. One notable example is the [Claude Code GitHub Actions](/en/docs/claude-code/github-actions), which uses the SDK to provide automated code review, PR creation, and issue triage capabilities directly in your GitHub workflow.

# Identity and Access Management

> Learn how to configure user authentication, authorization, and access controls for Claude Code in your organization.

## Authentication methods

Setting up Claude Code requires access to Anthropic models. For teams, you can set up Claude Code access in one of three ways:

* Anthropic API via the Anthropic Console
* Amazon Bedrock
* Google Vertex AI

### Anthropic API authentication

**To set up Claude Code access for your team via Anthropic API:**

1. Use your existing Anthropic Console account or create a new Anthropic Console account
2. You can add users through either method below:
   * Bulk invite users from within the Console (Console -> Settings -> Members -> Invite)
   * [Set up SSO](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/10280258-setting-up-single-sign-on-on-the-api-console)
3. When inviting users, they need one of the following roles:
   * "Claude Code" role means users can only create Claude Code API keys
   * "Developer" role means users can create any kind of API key
4. Each invited user needs to complete these steps:
   * Accept the Console invite
   * [Check system requirements](/en/docs/claude-code/setup#system-requirements)
   * [Install Claude Code](/en/docs/claude-code/setup#installation)
   * Login with Console account credentials

### Cloud provider authentication

**To set up Claude Code access for your team via Bedrock or Vertex:**

1. Follow the [Bedrock docs](/en/docs/claude-code/amazon-bedrock) or [Vertex docs](/en/docs/claude-code/google-vertex-ai)
2. Distribute the environment variables and instructions for generating cloud credentials to your users. Read more about how to [manage configuration here](/en/docs/claude-code/settings).
3. Users can [install Claude Code](/en/docs/claude-code/setup#installation)

## Access control and permissions

We support fine-grained permissions so that you're able to specify exactly what the agent is allowed to do (e.g. run tests, run linter) and what it is not allowed to do (e.g. update cloud infrastructure). These permission settings can be checked into version control and distributed to all developers in your organization, as well as customized by individual developers.

### Permission system

Claude Code uses a tiered permission system to balance power and safety:

| Tool Type         | Example              | Approval Required | "Yes, don't ask again" Behavior               |
| :---------------- | :------------------- | :---------------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| Read-only         | File reads, LS, Grep | No                | N/A                                           |
| Bash Commands     | Shell execution      | Yes               | Permanently per project directory and command |
| File Modification | Edit/write files     | Yes               | Until session end                             |

### Configuring permissions

You can view & manage Claude Code's tool permissions with `/permissions`. This UI lists all permission rules and the settings.json file they are sourced from.

* **Allow** rules will allow Claude Code to use the specified tool without further manual approval.
* **Deny** rules will prevent Claude Code from using the specified tool. Deny rules take precedence over allow rules.
* **Additional directories** extend Claude's file access to directories beyond the initial working directory.
* **Default mode** controls Claude's permission behavior when encountering new requests.

Permission rules use the format: `Tool(optional-specifier)`

A rule that is just the tool name matches any use of that tool. For example, adding `Bash` to the list of allow rules would allow Claude Code to use the Bash tool without requiring user approval.

#### Permission modes

Claude Code supports several permission modes that can be set as the `defaultMode` in [settings files](/en/docs/claude-code/settings#settings-files):

| Mode                | Description                                                                  |
| :------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `default`           | Standard behavior - prompts for permission on first use of each tool         |
| `acceptEdits`       | Automatically accepts file edit permissions for the session                  |
| `plan`              | Plan mode - Claude can analyze but not modify files or execute commands      |
| `bypassPermissions` | Skips all permission prompts (requires safe environment - see warning below) |

#### Working directories

By default, Claude has access to files in the directory where it was launched. You can extend this access:

* **During startup**: Use `--add-dir <path>` CLI argument
* **During session**: Use `/add-dir` slash command
* **Persistent configuration**: Add to `additionalDirectories` in [settings files](/en/docs/claude-code/settings#settings-files)

Files in additional directories follow the same permission rules as the original working directory - they become readable without prompts, and file editing permissions follow the current permission mode.

#### Tool-specific permission rules

Some tools use the optional specifier for more fine-grained permission controls. For example, an allow rule with `Bash(git diff:*)` would allow Bash commands that start with `git diff`. The following tools support permission rules with specifiers:

**Bash**

* `Bash(npm run build)` Matches the exact Bash command `npm run build`
* `Bash(npm run test:*)` Matches Bash commands starting with `npm run test`.

<Tip>
  Claude Code is aware of shell operators (like `&&`) so a prefix match rule like `Bash(safe-cmd:*)` won't give it permission to run the command `safe-cmd && other-cmd`
</Tip>

**Read & Edit**

`Edit` rules apply to all built-in tools that edit files. Claude will make a best-effort attempt to apply `Read` rules to all built-in tools that read files like Grep, Glob, and LS.

Read & Edit rules both follow the [gitignore](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) specification. Patterns are resolved relative to the directory containing `.claude/settings.json`. To reference an absolute path, use `//`. For a path relative to your home directory, use `~/`.

* `Edit(docs/**)` Matches edits to files in the `docs` directory of your project
* `Read(~/.zshrc)` Matches reads to your `~/.zshrc` file
* `Edit(//tmp/scratch.txt)` Matches edits to `/tmp/scratch.txt`

**WebFetch**

* `WebFetch(domain:example.com)` Matches fetch requests to example.com

**MCP**

* `mcp__puppeteer` Matches any tool provided by the `puppeteer` server (name configured in Claude Code)
* `mcp__puppeteer__puppeteer_navigate` Matches the `puppeteer_navigate` tool provided by the `puppeteer` server

### Enterprise managed policy settings

For enterprise deployments of Claude Code, we support enterprise managed policy settings that take precedence over user and project settings. This allows system administrators to enforce security policies that users cannot override.

System administrators can deploy policies to:

* **macOS**: `/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/managed-settings.json`
* **Linux and Windows (via WSL)**: `/etc/claude-code/managed-settings.json`

These policy files follow the same format as regular [settings files](/en/docs/claude-code/settings#settings-files) but cannot be overridden by user or project settings. This ensures consistent security policies across your organization.

### Settings precedence

When multiple settings sources exist, they are applied in the following order (highest to lowest precedence):

1. Enterprise policies
2. Command line arguments
3. Local project settings (`.claude/settings.local.json`)
4. Shared project settings (`.claude/settings.json`)
5. User settings (`~/.claude/settings.json`)

This hierarchy ensures that organizational policies are always enforced while still allowing flexibility at the project and user levels where appropriate.

### Additional permission control with hooks

[Claude Code hooks](/en/docs/claude-code/hooks) provide a way to register custom shell commands to perform permission evaluation at runtime. When Claude Code makes a tool call, PreToolUse hooks run before the permission system runs, and the hook output can determine whether to approve or deny the tool call in place of the permission system.

## Credential management

Claude Code supports authentication via Claude.ai credentials, Anthropic API credentials, Bedrock Auth, and Vertex Auth. On macOS, the API keys, OAuth tokens, and other credentials are stored on encrypted macOS Keychain. Alternately, the setting [apiKeyHelper](/en/docs/claude-code/settings#available-settings) can be set to a shell script which returns an API key. By default, this helper is called after 5 minutes or on HTTP 401 response; specifying environment variable `CLAUDE_CODE_API_KEY_HELPER_TTL_MS` defines a custom refresh interval.

### Configuring permissions

You can view & manage Claude Code's tool permissions with `/permissions`. This UI lists all permission rules and the settings.json file they are sourced from.

* **Allow** rules will allow Claude Code to use the specified tool without further manual approval.
* **Deny** rules will prevent Claude Code from using the specified tool. Deny rules take precedence over allow rules.
* **Additional directories** extend Claude's file access to directories beyond the initial working directory.
* **Default mode** controls Claude's permission behavior when encountering new requests.

Permission rules use the format: `Tool(optional-specifier)`

A rule that is just the tool name matches any use of that tool. For example, adding `Bash` to the list of allow rules would allow Claude Code to use the Bash tool without requiring user approval.

#### Permission modes

Claude Code supports several permission modes that can be set as the `defaultMode` in [settings files](/en/docs/claude-code/settings#settings-files):

| Mode                | Description                                                                  |
| :------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `default`           | Standard behavior - prompts for permission on first use of each tool         |
| `acceptEdits`       | Automatically accepts file edit permissions for the session                  |
| `plan`              | Plan mode - Claude can analyze but not modify files or execute commands      |
| `bypassPermissions` | Skips all permission prompts (requires safe environment - see warning below) |

#### Working directories

By default, Claude has access to files in the directory where it was launched. You can extend this access:

* **During startup**: Use `--add-dir <path>` CLI argument
* **During session**: Use `/add-dir` slash command
* **Persistent configuration**: Add to `additionalDirectories` in [settings files](/en/docs/claude-code/settings#settings-files)

Files in additional directories follow the same permission rules as the original working directory - they become readable without prompts, and file editing permissions follow the current permission mode.

#### Tool-specific permission rules

Some tools use the optional specifier for more fine-grained permission controls. For example, an allow rule with `Bash(git diff:*)` would allow Bash commands that start with `git diff`. The following tools support permission rules with specifiers:

**Bash**

* `Bash(npm run build)` Matches the exact Bash command `npm run build`
* `Bash(npm run test:*)` Matches Bash commands starting with `npm run test`.

<Tip>
  Claude Code is aware of shell operators (like `&&`) so a prefix match rule like `Bash(safe-cmd:*)` won't give it permission to run the command `safe-cmd && other-cmd`
</Tip>

**Read & Edit**

`Edit` rules apply to all built-in tools that edit files. Claude will make a best-effort attempt to apply `Read` rules to all built-in tools that read files like Grep, Glob, and LS.

Read & Edit rules both follow the [gitignore](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) specification. Patterns are resolved relative to the directory containing `.claude/settings.json`. To reference an absolute path, use `//`. For a path relative to your home directory, use `~/`.

* `Edit(docs/**)` Matches edits to files in the `docs` directory of your project
* `Read(~/.zshrc)` Matches reads to your `~/.zshrc` file
* `Edit(//tmp/scratch.txt)` Matches edits to `/tmp/scratch.txt`

**WebFetch**

* `WebFetch(domain:example.com)` Matches fetch requests to example.com

**MCP**

* `mcp__puppeteer` Matches any tool provided by the `puppeteer` server (name configured in Claude Code)
* `mcp__puppeteer__puppeteer_navigate` Matches the `puppeteer_navigate` tool provided by the `puppeteer` server

### Settings precedence

When multiple settings sources exist, they are applied in the following order (highest to lowest precedence):

1. Enterprise policies
2. Command line arguments
3. Local project settings (`.claude/settings.local.json`)
4. Shared project settings (`.claude/settings.json`)
5. User settings (`~/.claude/settings.json`)

This hierarchy ensures that organizational policies are always enforced while still allowing flexibility at the project and user levels where appropriate.

### Additional permission control with hooks

[Claude Code hooks](/en/docs/claude-code/hooks) provide a way to register custom shell commands to perform permission evaluation at runtime. When Claude Code makes a tool call, PreToolUse hooks run before the permission system runs, and the hook output can determine whether to approve or deny the tool call in place of the permission system.

## Command history

Claude Code maintains command history for the current session:

* History is stored per working directory
* Cleared with `/clear` command
* Use Up/Down arrows to navigate (see keyboard shortcuts above)
* **Ctrl+R**: Reverse search through history (if supported by terminal)
* **Note**: History expansion (`!`) is disabled by default

## Custom slash commands

Custom slash commands allow you to define frequently-used prompts as Markdown files that Claude Code can execute. Commands are organized by scope (project-specific or personal) and support namespacing through directory structures.

### Syntax

```
/<prefix>:<command-name> [arguments]
```

#### Parameters

| Parameter        | Description                                                         |
| :--------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `<prefix>`       | Command scope (`project` for project-specific, `user` for personal) |
| `<command-name>` | Name derived from the Markdown filename (without `.md` extension)   |
| `[arguments]`    | Optional arguments passed to the command                            |

### Command types

#### Project commands

Commands stored in your repository and shared with your team.

**Location**: `.claude/commands/`\
**Prefix**: `/project:`

In the following example, we create the `/project:optimize` command:

```bash
# Create a project command
mkdir -p .claude/commands
echo "Analyze this code for performance issues and suggest optimizations:" > .claude/commands/optimize.md
```

#### Personal commands

Commands available across all your projects.

**Location**: `~/.claude/commands/`\
**Prefix**: `/user:`

In the following example, we create the  `/user:security-review` command:

```bash
# Create a personal command
mkdir -p ~/.claude/commands
echo "Review this code for security vulnerabilities:" > ~/.claude/commands/security-review.md
```

### Features

#### Namespacing

Organize commands in subdirectories to create namespaced commands.

**Structure**: `<prefix>:<namespace>:<command>`

For example, a file at `.claude/commands/frontend/component.md` creates the command `/project:frontend:component`

#### Arguments

Pass dynamic values to commands using the `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder.

For example:

```bash
# Command definition
echo "Fix issue #$ARGUMENTS following our coding standards" > .claude/commands/fix-issue.md

# Usage
> /project:fix-issue 123
```

#### Bash command execution

Execute bash commands before the slash command runs using the `!` prefix. The output is included in the command context.

For example:

```markdown
---
allowed-tools: Bash(git add:*), Bash(git status:*), Bash(git commit:*)
description: Create a git commit
---

## Context

- Current git status: !`git status`
- Current git diff (staged and unstaged changes): !`git diff HEAD`
- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Recent commits: !`git log --oneline -10`

## Your task

Based on the above changes, create a single git commit.
```

#### File references

Include file contents in commands using the `@` prefix to [reference files](/en/docs/claude-code/common-workflows#reference-files-and-directories).

For example:

```markdown
# Reference a specific file
Review the implementation in @src/utils/helpers.js

# Reference multiple files
Compare @src/old-version.js with @src/new-version.js
```

#### Thinking mode

Slash commands can trigger extended thinking by including [extended thinking keywords](/en/docs/claude-code/common-workflows#use-extended-thinking).

### File format

Command files support:

* **Markdown format** (`.md` extension)
* **YAML frontmatter** for metadata:
  * `allowed-tools`: List of tools the command can use
  * `description`: Brief description of the command
* **Dynamic content** with bash commands (`!`) and file references (`@`)
* **Prompt instructions** as the main content

## MCP slash commands

MCP servers can expose prompts as slash commands that become available in Claude Code. These commands are dynamically discovered from connected MCP servers.

### Command format

MCP commands follow the pattern:

```
/mcp__<server-name>__<prompt-name> [arguments]
```

### Features

#### Dynamic discovery

MCP commands are automatically available when:

* An MCP server is connected and active
* The server exposes prompts through the MCP protocol
* The prompts are successfully retrieved during connection

#### Arguments

MCP prompts can accept arguments defined by the server:

```
# Without arguments
> /mcp__github__list_prs

# With arguments
> /mcp__github__pr_review 456
> /mcp__jira__create_issue "Bug title" high
```

#### Naming conventions

* Server and prompt names are normalized
* Spaces and special characters become underscores
* Names are lowercased for consistency

### Managing MCP connections

Use the `/mcp` command to:

* View all configured MCP servers
* Check connection status
* Authenticate with OAuth-enabled servers
* Clear authentication tokens
* View available tools and prompts from each server

# Claude Code settings

> Configure Claude Code with global and project-level settings, and environment variables.

Claude Code offers a variety of settings to configure its behavior to meet your needs. You can configure Claude Code by running the `/config` command when using the interactive REPL.

## Settings files

The `settings.json` file is our official mechanism for configuring Claude
Code through hierarchical settings:

* **User settings** are defined in `~/.claude/settings.json` and apply to all
  projects.
* **Project settings** are saved in your project directory:
  * `.claude/settings.json` for settings that are checked into source control and shared with your team
  * `.claude/settings.local.json` for settings that are not checked in, useful for personal preferences and experimentation. Claude Code will configure git to ignore `.claude/settings.local.json` when it is created.
* For enterprise deployments of Claude Code, we also support **enterprise
  managed policy settings**. These take precedence over user and project
  settings. System administrators can deploy policies to
  `/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/managed-settings.json` on macOS and
  `/etc/claude-code/managed-settings.json` on Linux and Windows via WSL.

```JSON Example settings.json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Bash(npm run lint)",
      "Bash(npm run test:*)",
      "Read(~/.zshrc)"
    ],
    "deny": [
      "Bash(curl:*)"
    ]
  },
  "env": {
    "CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TELEMETRY": "1",
    "OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER": "otlp"
  }
}
```

### Available settings

`settings.json` supports a number of options:

### Settings precedence

Settings are applied in order of precedence:

1. Enterprise policies (see [IAM documentation](/en/docs/claude-code/iam#enterprise-managed-policy-settings))
2. Command line arguments
3. Local project settings
4. Shared project settings
5. User settings

## Environment variables

Claude Code supports the following environment variables to control its behavior:

<Note>
  All environment variables can also be configured in [`settings.json`](#available-settings). This is useful as a way to automatically set environment variables for each session, or to roll out a set of environment variables for your whole team or organization.

## Configuration options

We are in the process of migrating global configuration to `settings.json`.

`claude config` will be deprecated in place of [settings.json](#settings-files)

To manage your configurations, use the following commands:

* List settings: `claude config list`
* See a setting: `claude config get <key>`
* Change a setting: `claude config set <key> <value>`
* Push to a setting (for lists): `claude config add <key> <value>`
* Remove from a setting (for lists): `claude config remove <key> <value>`

By default `config` changes your project configuration. To manage your global configuration, use the `--global` (or `-g`) flag.

### Global configuration

To set a global configuration, use `claude config set -g <key> <value>`:

## Tools available to Claude

Claude Code has access to a set of powerful tools that help it understand and modify your codebase:

| Tool             | Description                                          | Permission Required |

Permission rules can be configured using `/allowed-tools` or in [permission settings](/en/docs/claude-code/settings#available-settings).

### Extending tools with hooks

You can run custom commands before or after any tool executes using
[Claude Code hooks](/en/docs/claude-code/hooks).

For example, you could automatically run a Python formatter after Claude
modifies Python files, or prevent modifications to production configuration
files by blocking Write operations to certain paths.

# Hooks

> Customize and extend Claude Code's behavior by registering shell commands

# Introduction

Claude Code hooks are user-defined shell commands that execute at various points
in Claude Code's lifecycle. Hooks provide deterministic control over Claude
Code's behavior, ensuring certain actions always happen rather than relying on
the LLM to choose to run them.

Example use cases include:

* **Notifications**: Customize how you get notified when Claude Code is awaiting
  your input or permission to run something.
* **Automatic formatting**: Run `prettier` on .ts files, `gofmt` on .go files,
  etc. after every file edit.
* **Logging**: Track and count all executed commands for compliance or
  debugging.
* **Feedback**: Provide automated feedback when Claude Code produces code that
  does not follow your codebase conventions.
* **Custom permissions**: Block modifications to production files or sensitive
  directories.

By encoding these rules as hooks rather than prompting instructions, you turn
suggestions into app-level code that executes every time it is expected to run.

<Warning>
  Hooks execute shell commands with your full user permissions without
  confirmation. You are responsible for ensuring your hooks are safe and secure.
  Anthropic is not liable for any data loss or system damage resulting from hook
  usage. Review [Security Considerations](#security-considerations).
</Warning>

## Quickstart

In this quickstart, you'll add a hook that logs the shell commands that Claude
Code runs.

Quickstart Prerequisite: Install `jq` for JSON processing in the command line.

### Step 1: Open hooks configuration

Run the `/hooks` [slash command](/en/docs/claude-code/slash-commands) and select
the `PreToolUse` hook event.

`PreToolUse` hooks run before tool calls and can block them while providing
Claude feedback on what to do differently.

### Step 2: Add a matcher

Select `+ Add new matcher…` to run your hook only on Bash tool calls.

Type `Bash` for the matcher.

### Step 3: Add the hook

Select `+ Add new hook…` and enter this command:

```bash
jq -r '"\(.tool_input.command) - \(.tool_input.description // "No description")"' >> ~/.claude/bash-command-log.txt
```

### Step 4: Save your configuration

For storage location, select `User settings` since you're logging to your home
directory. This hook will then apply to all projects, not just your current
project.

Then press Esc until you return to the REPL. Your hook is now registered!

### Step 5: Verify your hook

Run `/hooks` again or check `~/.claude/settings.json` to see your configuration:

```json
"hooks": {
  "PreToolUse": [
    {
      "matcher": "Bash",
      "hooks": [
        {
          "type": "command",
          "command": "jq -r '\"\\(.tool_input.command) - \\(.tool_input.description // \"No description\")\"' >> ~/.claude/bash-command-log.txt"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Configuration

Claude Code hooks are configured in your
[settings files](/en/docs/claude-code/settings):

* `~/.claude/settings.json` - User settings
* `.claude/settings.json` - Project settings
* `.claude/settings.local.json` - Local project settings (not committed)
* Enterprise managed policy settings

### Structure

Hooks are organized by matchers, where each matcher can have multiple hooks:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "EventName": [
      {
        "matcher": "ToolPattern",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "your-command-here"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

* **matcher**: Pattern to match tool names (only applicable for `PreToolUse` and
  `PostToolUse`)
  * Simple strings match exactly: `Write` matches only the Write tool
  * Supports regex: `Edit|Write` or `Notebook.*`
  * If omitted or empty string, hooks run for all matching events
* **hooks**: Array of commands to execute when the pattern matches
  * `type`: Currently only `"command"` is supported
  * `command`: The bash command to execute

## Hook Events

### PreToolUse

Runs after Claude creates tool parameters and before processing the tool call.

**Common matchers:**

* `Task` - Agent tasks
* `Bash` - Shell commands
* `Glob` - File pattern matching
* `Grep` - Content search
* `Read` - File reading
* `Edit`, `MultiEdit` - File editing
* `Write` - File writing
* `WebFetch`, `WebSearch` - Web operations

### PostToolUse

Runs immediately after a tool completes successfully.

Recognizes the same matcher values as PreToolUse.

### Notification

Runs when Claude Code sends notifications.

### Stop

Runs when Claude Code has finished responding.

## Hook Input

Hooks receive JSON data via stdin containing session information and
event-specific data:

```typescript
{
  // Common fields
  session_id: string
  transcript_path: string  // Path to conversation JSON

  // Event-specific fields
  ...
}
```

### PreToolUse Input

The exact schema for `tool_input` depends on the tool.

```json
{
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "transcript_path": "~/.claude/projects/.../00893aaf-19fa-41d2-8238-13269b9b3ca0.jsonl",
  "tool_name": "Write",
  "tool_input": {
    "file_path": "/path/to/file.txt",
    "content": "file content"
  }
}
```

### PostToolUse Input

The exact schema for `tool_input` and `tool_response` depends on the tool.

```json
{
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "transcript_path": "~/.claude/projects/.../00893aaf-19fa-41d2-8238-13269b9b3ca0.jsonl",
  "tool_name": "Write",
  "tool_input": {
    "file_path": "/path/to/file.txt",
    "content": "file content"
  },
  "tool_response": {
    "filePath": "/path/to/file.txt",
    "success": true
  }
}
```

### Notification Input

```json
{
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "transcript_path": "~/.claude/projects/.../00893aaf-19fa-41d2-8238-13269b9b3ca0.jsonl",
  "message": "Task completed successfully",
  "title": "Claude Code"
}
```

### Stop Input

`stop_hook_active` is true when Claude Code is already continuing as a result of
a stop hook. Check this value or process the transcript to prevent Claude Code
from running indefinitely.

```json
{
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "transcript_path": "~/.claude/projects/.../00893aaf-19fa-41d2-8238-13269b9b3ca0.jsonl",
  "stop_hook_active": true
}
```

## Hook Output

There are two ways for hooks to return output back to Claude Code. The output
communicates whether to block and any feedback that should be shown to Claude
and the user.

### Simple: Exit Code

Hooks communicate status through exit codes, stdout, and stderr:

* **Exit code 0**: Success. `stdout` is shown to the user in transcript mode
  (CTRL-R).
* **Exit code 2**: Blocking error. `stderr` is fed back to Claude to process
  automatically. See per-hook-event behavior below.
* **Other exit codes**: Non-blocking error. `stderr` is shown to the user and
  execution continues.

#### Exit Code 2 Behavior

| Hook Event     | Behavior                                    |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `PreToolUse`   | Blocks the tool call, shows error to Claude |
| `PostToolUse`  | Shows error to Claude (tool already ran)    |
| `Notification` | N/A, shows stderr to user only              |
| `Stop`         | Blocks stoppage, shows error to Claude      |

### Advanced: JSON Output

Hooks can return structured JSON in `stdout` for more sophisticated control:

#### Common JSON Fields

All hook types can include these optional fields:

```json
{
  "continue": true, // Whether Claude should continue after hook execution (default: true)
  "stopReason": "string" // Message shown when continue is false
  "suppressOutput": true, // Hide stdout from transcript mode (default: false)
}
```

If `continue` is false, Claude stops processing after the hooks run.

* For `PreToolUse`, this is different from `"decision": "block"`, which only
  blocks a specific tool call and provides automatic feedback to Claude.
* For `PostToolUse`, this is different from `"decision": "block"`, which
  provides automated feedback to Claude.
* For `Stop`, this takes precedence over any `"decision": "block"` output.
* In all cases, `"continue" = false` takes precedence over any
  `"decision": "block"` output.

`stopReason` accompanies `continue` with a reason shown to the user, not shown
to Claude.

#### `PreToolUse` Decision Control

`PreToolUse` hooks can control whether a tool call proceeds.

* "approve" bypasses the permission system. `reason` is shown to the user but
  not to Claude.
* "block" prevents the tool call from executing. `reason` is shown to Claude.
* `undefined` leads to the existing permission flow. `reason` is ignored.

```json
{
  "decision": "approve" | "block" | undefined,
  "reason": "Explanation for decision"
}
```

#### `PostToolUse` Decision Control

`PostToolUse` hooks can control whether a tool call proceeds.

* "block" automatically prompts Claude with `reason`.
* `undefined` does nothing. `reason` is ignored.

```json
{
  "decision": "block" | undefined,
  "reason": "Explanation for decision"
}
```

#### `Stop` Decision Control

`Stop` hooks can control whether Claude must continue.

* "block" prevents Claude from stopping. You must populate `reason` for Claude
  to know how to proceed.
* `undefined` allows Claude to stop. `reason` is ignored.

```json
{
  "decision": "block" | undefined,
  "reason": "Must be provided when Claude is blocked from stopping"
}
```

#### JSON Output Example: Bash Command Editing

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import json
import re
import sys

# Define validation rules as a list of (regex pattern, message) tuples
VALIDATION_RULES = [
    (
        r"\bgrep\b(?!.*\|)",
        "Use 'rg' (ripgrep) instead of 'grep' for better performance and features",
    ),
    (
        r"\bfind\s+\S+\s+-name\b",
        "Use 'rg --files | rg pattern' or 'rg --files -g pattern' instead of 'find -name' for better performance",
    ),
]


def validate_command(command: str) -> list[str]:
    issues = []
    for pattern, message in VALIDATION_RULES:
        if re.search(pattern, command):
            issues.append(message)
    return issues


try:
    input_data = json.load(sys.stdin)
except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
    print(f"Error: Invalid JSON input: {e}", file=sys.stderr)
    sys.exit(1)

tool_name = input_data.get("tool_name", "")
tool_input = input_data.get("tool_input", {})
command = tool_input.get("command", "")

if tool_name != "Bash" or not command:
    sys.exit(1)

# Validate the command
issues = validate_command(command)

if issues:
    for message in issues:
        print(f"• {message}", file=sys.stderr)
    # Exit code 2 blocks tool call and shows stderr to Claude
    sys.exit(2)
```

#### `Stop` Decision Control

`Stop` hooks can control tool execution:

```json
{
  "decision": "approve" | "block",
  "reason": "Human-readable explanation"
}
```

## Working with MCP Tools

Claude Code hooks work seamlessly with
[Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools](/en/docs/claude-code/mcp). When MCP servers
provide tools, they appear with a special naming pattern that you can match in
your hooks.

### MCP Tool Naming

MCP tools follow the pattern `mcp__<server>__<tool>`, for example:

* `mcp__memory__create_entities` - Memory server's create entities tool
* `mcp__filesystem__read_file` - Filesystem server's read file tool
* `mcp__github__search_repositories` - GitHub server's search tool

### Configuring Hooks for MCP Tools

You can target specific MCP tools or entire MCP servers:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "mcp__memory__.*",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "echo 'Memory operation initiated' >> ~/mcp-operations.log"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "matcher": "mcp__.*__write.*",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "/home/user/scripts/validate-mcp-write.py"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Examples

### Code Formatting

Automatically format code after file modifications:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Write|Edit|MultiEdit",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "/home/user/scripts/format-code.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Notification

Customize the notification that is sent when Claude Code requests permission or
when the prompt input has become idle.

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "Notification": [
      {
        "matcher": "",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "python3 ~/my_custom_notifier.py"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Security Considerations

### Disclaimer

**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**: Claude Code hooks execute arbitrary shell commands on
your system automatically. By using hooks, you acknowledge that:

* You are solely responsible for the commands you configure
* Hooks can modify, delete, or access any files your user account can access
* Malicious or poorly written hooks can cause data loss or system damage
* Anthropic provides no warranty and assumes no liability for any damages
  resulting from hook usage
* You should thoroughly test hooks in a safe environment before production use

Always review and understand any hook commands before adding them to your
configuration.

### Security Best Practices

Here are some key practices for writing more secure hooks:

1. **Validate and sanitize inputs** - Never trust input data blindly
2. **Always quote shell variables** - Use `"$VAR"` not `$VAR`
3. **Block path traversal** - Check for `..` in file paths
4. **Use absolute paths** - Specify full paths for scripts
5. **Skip sensitive files** - Avoid `.env`, `.git/`, keys, etc.

### Configuration Safety

Direct edits to hooks in settings files don't take effect immediately. Claude
Code:

1. Captures a snapshot of hooks at startup
2. Uses this snapshot throughout the session
3. Warns if hooks are modified externally
4. Requires review in `/hooks` menu for changes to apply

This prevents malicious hook modifications from affecting your current session.

## Hook Execution Details

* **Timeout**: 60-second execution limit
* **Parallelization**: All matching hooks run in parallel
* **Environment**: Runs in current directory with Claude Code's environment
* **Input**: JSON via stdin
* **Output**:
  * PreToolUse/PostToolUse/Stop: Progress shown in transcript (Ctrl-R)
  * Notification: Logged to debug only (`--debug`)

## Debugging

To troubleshoot hooks:

1. Check if `/hooks` menu displays your configuration
2. Verify that your [settings files](/en/docs/claude-code/settings) are valid
   JSON
3. Test commands manually
4. Check exit codes
5. Review stdout and stderr format expectations
6. Ensure proper quote escaping

Progress messages appear in transcript mode (Ctrl-R) showing:

* Which hook is running
* Command being executed
* Success/failure status
* Output or error messages
