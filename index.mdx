## Quick Start

### For Claude Code Users

<Steps>
  <Step title="Reference in CLAUDE.md">
    Import documentation standards in your project's CLAUDE.md:
    ```markdown
    # Import documentation standards
    @~/Developer/docs/apps/docs.md
    
    # Import specific patterns
    @~/Developer/docs/apps/patterns.md#state-management
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use in Commands">
    Reference documentation directly in commands:
    ```bash
    # Reference documentation
    @~/Developer/docs/prompts/code/code-review.xml
    "Review this implementation"
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Custom Commands">
    Build custom commands that reference docs:
    ```bash
    # Reference docs in custom commands
    cat > ~/.claude/commands/standards.md << 'EOF'
    # Apply Documentation Standards
    
    Apply our documentation standards to the current project.
    
    @~/Developer/docs/apps/docs.md
    
    $ARGUMENTS
    EOF
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
